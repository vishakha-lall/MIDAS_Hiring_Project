#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

All in the current containment areas. 82 have recovered. No deaths. 4, out of the total ~1000 active cases, are currently getting treatment while all the others are asymptomatic and healthy. Rapid testing kits (Antibody kits) have been distributed to most districts and are now operational. TN currently has 36,000 rapid kits (24,000 ordered directly by the state and 12,000 given by the center) and 1,95,000 PCR kits. It has 2 automated testing machines. Current mortality rate in TN is 1.1%. ICMR's current guidelines are to test those with ILI (influenza like illnesses), SARI (severe acute respiratory illnesses) and any essential workers with symptoms.

For those who are positive, they are checking oxygen saturation multiple times to see if they're having asymptotic hypoxia. They are also taking CT scans and chest X-rays. A person is discharged only if they get 2 consecutive negative tests.

1. it's good that cops caught a hold of these mischief makers but this vindictive humiliation trip is not something to be celebrated. The police isn't supposed to deliver punishment. Issue a citation, or for bad offences book them under the relevant sections of the penal code. Produce them in front of a judge. There are a lot of legal, dignified ways to tackle this.
2. They spent their time and energy using the state machinery to track down some idiots making fun of the police and made an example out of them. That's a little petty. People say all sorts of nonsense on social media *all the time*. For eg: Rangoli Chandel openly advocated for violence and called for cancelling elections on social media: both of which are pretty dangerous and illegal things. I don't recall the police showing up and making her parade around Santa Cruz or wherever. I've seen blatantly law-breaking, derogatory, xenophobic stuff on TikTok constantly, but the police doesn't seem to care much about that. We must acknowledge there's power and privilege equations at play here. If you have doubts read the article and judge the economic strata of these ""covidiots"" and take a note of their names. I'll leave it at that.
3. What sort of a serious journalistic outlet uses 'covidiot' in the headline? objective much?;[removed];This is incredibly petty. Since they violated lockdown they could be pulled up for that, but people are allowed to make fun of authorities or of anyone else.

**Tl;dr**

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has sought to revise its Request for Proposals (RFP) for tender bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) according to an update on its website dated March 23, 2020. IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   


**Background on AFRS**

The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  


1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  


The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB.  According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  


As pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.   


**Steps taken by IFF**  


IFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.

In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  


1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology
3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  


**What’s Next?**

IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

Arindam Sil, a top filmmaker, has started directing a movie, titled Ek Din Jhor Theme Jabe (One day the Storm will End). The lines, interestingly, are from a poem penned by Mamata Banerjee herself. Some of the TMC MPs, Nursat Jahan and Mimi Chakraborty, will act in the film. But in reality movies—claim critics—will not work.

People have died and health care workers have also succumbed because of it. I have not seen the media targeting those groups like this, except for calling them out for what they did. This repeated mention of TJ in every statement compounds the problem. 

They should be called out for the gross negligence and danger to tbe population as a whole they caused. But making this whole conversation a running commentary on TJ and their vilification makes the discourse counterproductive. 

The attack on health care workers and police is a result of the distrust on the government (not any party but as a whole or maybe otherwise). At a time where asymptomatic patients are testing positive after 28-30 days this narrative can result in underreporting of symptoms fearing retribution. Everyone understands what happened, so stop dwelling on it, move forward, create trust. In the end this virus is more of an economic and social problem than a medical one. 

Social unity and physical distancing is what we need right now


*Cue the downvotes*;There have been multiple gatherings which have spread infections. Each of it is reckless, unfortunate and deserves sympathy. Can we stop singling out the Tablighi Jamaat every time? the narrative that they have singlehandedly spread the virus is not true, and very counterproductive.

Our society and police are not kind people on average. Majority of cases don't even make it to courts.

Mainstream media and social media are really your only friends for any semblance of sympathy and ""justice"".

Further, many of our people, including or especially ""educated"" ones, have a tendency to trust the police and blame victims.

This could happen to anybody, including you.

So, everytime you step out, please use and activate things like silent audio recorder apps at the very least.

One hospital did issue a gag order, but not the govt:

> Immediately after the government order, GTB Hospital director Sunil Kumar sent a gag order to all the health staff on COVID-19 duty.

> At Lok Nayak Hospital, while no order was issued, the medical director called several nurses to explain about their posts about their unhygienic stay and lack of food on social media.;I can’t ever seem to get a read on Kejriwal man.

> “Period. End of Sentence.” (Short Film): Director Rayka Zehtabchi tells the story of women in a rural village outside Delhi, India, who learn to manufacture and market their own sanitary pads.

About the film: https://www.news18.com/news/movies/period-end-of-sentence-review-this-netflix-documentary-is-aspirational-in-principle-impactful-in-general-2034769.html

> Rayka Zehtabchi’s short directorial is aimed at unwrapping stigma, fear, insecurity, ignorance and bad education, inherent in a woman’s life. Her tool--a humble looking sanitary pad. The film opens inside a room, two girls in their adolescent years, shying away when asked to talk about menstruation. 

> As is revealed, we all know of it but we don’t talk about it. “Menstruation is the biggest taboo in India”, points out Arunachalam Murauganantham, the social activist from Coimbatore, who is leading the crusade of making India into a 100 per cent sanitary napkin using country.

> We meet characters that champion the filmmaker’s cause. We are introduced to Sneha, Rekha, Shabana and other unnamed heroes of the film that are entrepreneurial, self-sufficient, smart and empathetic. Here, they are not dealing with issues limited only to their village, but are shouting out at the ones that are much bigger than them.

Guess it makes sense. WB is following suit to make their own Disney Plus(HBO MAX) and with Disney Plus merging with Hotstar, it shouldnt be totally unexpected that all the Disney-competitor stuff leave.

thereof is visited by, or threatened with, an outbreak of any dangerous epidemic disease, the 8

person or class of persons as 9
[it] shall deem necessary to prevent the outbreak of such disease or 
the spread thereof, and may determine in what manner and by whom any expenses incurred 
(including compensation if any) shall be defrayed.

>Penalty.—Any person disobeying any regulation or order made under this Act shall be 
deemed to have committed an offence punishable under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code

Choosing even a simple goal for ourselves, like learning to sing a song by next week, for the simple reason that we *can*, is rejuvenating in that it opens our eyes to the shear potency of our lives.

I was my mom's tech support for their online meetings and I noticed most teachers have bad internet, some  teachers have their kids living away as far as a different city and other countries. 

We have a desktop and a printer so I prepared some teaching aids on paper for a demo lecture,  but they are barely visible from the front camera of mom's phone.

I hear the audio from other teachers and it was terrible, most have broken headphones or had background noise that they wouldn't know would be hear by others.

They even told the teachers to create a demo video, to which I and my mom finished it in 24 hours, as I am an Animation student and knew something about video editing and recording, we had the best audio and editing amount all, as nobody could even come up with and idea for video, I never thought that my knowledge in film making would be used like this but okay.

I know I am sounding like I am complaining, but this is how the situation is, and I am doing most of what I can.;Work in a MNC Investment Bank. 

Initially the set up wasnt conducive. Laptop height was low, kepboard was not at a proper level. I started having shoulder pain, and back pain. However, using some things, I have managed to replicate my office set-up. I have started to settle into WFH in the past 2-3 weeks. 

However, I do not like it. I am much more distracted at home. There are network issues in the afternoon. No interaction with colleagues, so doing things takes a lot more time. Moreover, I dont feel like doign anything in the morning. 

I used to be very active and productive (outside of work hours). But now, I have just become lazy. I never wished for WFH before, and will not wish for WFH ever.;Honestly, I feel WFH should actually be a mandatory policy wherever possible. For me, at least, and I am sure for many too, you just save so much commute time. I genuinely have been able to get tasks done a lot quicker. 


However, no boundaries as to ""office"" timings. We generally start around 10-10.30, but I randomly get calls from my colleagues/ boss at odd hours, too.;it's going exceptionally well. 

but i do get the odd panic attack about what would happen if there's a power cut. my house doesn't have a back up \ generator. 

and my washed up office laptop cannot function for even 30 mins without a steady power source. 

also with so many people logged in to desktops, laptops, near constant charging of mobile phones, other devices - i'm half afraid the nearest transformer won't blow up due to excess load. 

OR if one faulty hair dryer \ extension cord panel in someone else's apartment won't blow the fuse for my building entirely.

a lot of large IT companies are now forced to make statements of how they'll willingly allow & encourage WFM even after this covid crisis, but talk is cheap & action is always lacking. will be interesting to see how they handle this afterwards.

my organization is putting out generic and much expected statement of freezing variable pay, promotions, hikes & bonuses. disappointed about this aspect.;No work given till now 


F R E E D O M;Absolutely amazing. I attend max 1 teams meeting of about 1 hr per day and that's it. Literally getting paid to sit home and do nothing. Best vacation I could ask for!

My org can't continue work from home as we manage our client's projects.;On the positive side, I save alot of time traveling and I can actually take a nap in the break time

But on the negetive side, my manager thinks I am available 24/7 so she just keeps giving me more and more work, even after the working hours

If I had to choose, I'd still choose this over regular office;I have been always working from home. Nothing new here.

My friends on the other hand who are extroverts are fucking hating it and some are in native places right now.. so Internet is shitty sometimes for them.;More work is definitely getting done, but I miss my friends and colleagues. I miss office. Staying cooped at home with parents is fine but gets very uncomfortable long term.;Just lost my job becoz of covid and cannot be done from home.. so if you have work from home experience- consider yourself super lucky..;Absolutely loving it.;Pretty good. I really love it! I used to spend two-three hours communting. plus getting ready and hurrying breakfast. 

I'm super grateful for this wfh.;At least, when it was office, I could leave work behind and go home. Now work has invaded home, I am still working 9 hrs a day, and there is no week off too. And the calls... oh god... they can come at any time. The reason is that a lot of my colleagues are stuck in their hometowns without much access to work. So I have been given a lion's share to complete. It may change soon. Still. I don't want this kind of WFH. (Tbh, I just don't want this work at all, so that may be worsening my feeelings...);Initially, it was quite hard. I ended up taking a small mid-day nap the first few days. From then on, I decided to take a morning shower like I do on normal workdays, it's helped me switch to work mode much more easily and I feel like I've hit my normal productivity levels.;i eat 7 times a day now, skinny guy here, great for adding some lazy fat. btw wfh sucks, atleast i don't have to work after leaving office, it never ends while being at home;Useless. I'm a bachelor and I've to cook my lunch. Earlier, i only used to cook my dinner but now with cooking and dishes, I'm losing my productivity. On the top of that, there is no physical activity as such.;Rubbish.;Work has become more hectic that ever. I start working at 10 in the morning and never know when to stop. We have adapted to the scenario pretty quickly. All our processes have changed and the entire organization seems to be working more than before. Productive for the company but I feel like if this continues for a while, I'll end up extremely exhausted once the lockdown ends, whenever that is.;lund behenchod."

> A prominent Taliban official who served as the group’s spokesman during some of its most devastating attacks, including the attempted assassination of the young activist Malala Yousafzai, has escaped from detention in Pakistan, claiming he had made a secret deal with the country’s security forces.

> If verified, the claim by the Taliban militant, Sajjid Mohmand, also known by his nom de guerre, Ehsanullah Ehsan, would bring renewed scrutiny to the country’s ties to the group. Pakistan’s security and intelligence forces have long been accused of harboring terrorist groups to use for their foreign and domestic policy objectives, which they have denied.

Nobody bothers to read perhaps.

Edit: another one says:

Every single entity in the power business is losing money, nobody wants to invest in the sector because no one cares about contracts and generators don't get paid.

I guess the author will be satisfied when everyone just packs up and goes home eventually and the country is left with severe power shortages.

If the Andhra Govt can arbitrarily declared contracts to be void and call for renegotiation, there is something fucking wrong and there is absolutely a need to enforce those contracts and do it quickly, not 5+ years later when the judicial system comes around to it.

As for private monopolies being better than public monopolies, first of all, none of the proposed privatisation is going to result in private monopolies. Private participation is either done through a PPP or through a licensee model. Not to mention that power distribution is a heavily regulated business. You have to bare it all before the regulator to set tariffs.

& despite this, private operators have consistently proved to be better than state discoms on metrics across the board. Just look at the metrics of Delhi Distribution when it was ""privatised"" in the 2000s.

The author also states that the bill seeks to eliminate subsidies and cross-subsidies and make electricity a luxury item. The author doesn't state that the bill seeks to calculate the tariffs without any subsidies so the tariff determined is actually reflective of the costs incurred and that if the Govt wants to subsidise any particular consumers, they should pay the consumers directly.

As for ""midst of the COVID-19 crisis"", does the author expect everyone in Govt to sit on their ass for months and get nothing done?

The only parties who benefit from the abysmal current state of the power sector in India are under performing state distribution companies and its employees. It is no surprise that the guy writing this article is a patron of a federation representing those exact parties."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Making herbal hand sanitizers:

Baba Ramdev, further shows how one can make an Ayurvedic hand sanitizer at home on India TV. Through this, you can make a hand sanitizer to avoid coronavirus. After thorough research by Baba Ramdev, this domestic and Ayurvedic hand sanitizer has been declared authentic. They say that it is absolutely herbal and it does not have any side effects. Have a look at how to make a home hand sanitizer.

**Ingredients:**

1-liter water

100 neem leaves10-20 basil leaves10 grams alum10 grams camphorAloe vera

&#x200B;

**Procedure**:

* First, put 100 grams of neem leaves in 1 liter of water.
* After that, add basil leaves and boil them well in water. Now put aloe vera in it.
* When the water boils well and about 600 to 700 mL of 1 liter is left, then add camphor and alum in it.

&#x200B;

Copied from the site mentioned.

This is exactly the English version of the WhatsApp status which was in Hindi.

&#x200B;

So, does thing actually work? If not, then this BS can be more dangerous as it gives a false sense of security and will actually prevent people from using alcohol based sanitizer.

There are two mosques near my house which keep blasting azaan on loudspeakers its extra annoying when they do something like that early in the morning and ruin your sleep.

And you single out Muslims in a country where kirtans, jaagrans and bhajans go on for literally whole nights and in a country where there are literally dozens of festivals around the year whose celebrations produce a lot more noise pollution than anything else. 

Either ask for a ban on ALL religious activities producing noise or on none. Which is exactly what he should have done. He should have tweeted, 'ALL sources of noise pollution need to end'. But, he singled out Muslims.

THAT is what made Nigam's tweet Islamophobic. The sheer hypocrisy. The double standards. The barely concealed hatred. THAT is what was so wrong with it.;Look I completely agree with Sonu Nigam NO ONE IS HATING ON RELIGION OR PEOPLE so if you're just hating on Hindus or Muslims you sure are one dumbass honestly. 

Sonu Nigam's view is: I am not hating on religion or against any religion even the temples and gurudwaras are disturbing even along with azaan it wakes up my sleep and is disturbing.

Analyze Time: What he is trying to say is even gurudwaras and temples are loud HE is a Hindu himself so he cannot be hating on his own religion then that makes no sense .so he even means azaan is disturbing he means temples, gurudwaras and azaan are all disturbing not just the Islam part.;While loud places of worship are a problem across religions, Sonu chose to bring it up *after* modi promoted the latent islamaphobia in the populace. 

It makes his actions absolutely transparent in intent.;There are many Muslim communities that don't play azan on loudspeaker. These people have their mu'azzins recite the azan in a microphone but within the mosque."

Not gonna lie, I'm secretly pleased because with the healthcare in the US under the Trump administration, I don't find practising medicine there quite as appealing. But the long distance as a married couple well into our 30s when we thought we'd be starting a family sucks. The only reason I'm trying just as hard to immigrate is because my husband has put in way too much effort and worked his ass off. Say what you will, but the US recognises and awards potential. The bureaucracy in India in his field is what drove him away. I don't want to take away years of hard work and toil away from him. 

I'm not going to sweat it about the ban though. Trump is the most unpredictable leader the world has seen after Idi Amin (even Hitler had a plan).

Personally UPSC is a bitch and will take the exam on 31st.

Pending interviews: I’m glad I’m done, but pre wont wait for the deferred interviews;I think they’ll delay. Any past record of the commission has little importance because these are unprecedented circumstances.;There's a 90% chance that UPSC will postpone prelims. Can't say the same about the interviews.

All the major centres such as Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Indore etc are going to be under some form of restriction even till mid-May easily with the intensity of rising cases(if not 100% lockdown).

Date: 22 April https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/coronavirus-huge-spike-in-cases-likely-in-mumbai-says-central-panel/article31400889.ece

Public transport might not be 100% available at the time of exam,  (buses or trains at least)

Some states such as Telangana have increased their lockdown to even 7th May.

And since the decision is to be taken around 3rd or 4th May(for an exam of this scale, they have to inform people well in advance), by that time, most restrictions would be there in place anyway so high probability of prelims getting postponed.

Going by the manner in which they're postponing even the notifications for various exams such as Medical services, CAPF etc they too are deliberating for a new date for the exams.

For interviews, they may be conducted within a fortnight of travel restrictions lifting as they don't require mass assembly/movement of people.;My wife is giving exam this year. 

It is almost conformed to be delayed. It would not likely be in May as it is a manual intensive pen & paper exam which is human resource intensive. Expected date is July as per their study circle.;I think they'll delay. Can't say for sure. Make sure to check the website daily. I think people's studies have been affected and I predict a significant amount might just skip the exam altogether, but don't count on the cut off falling.

So it's kind of non cooperation from one side of the conflict. 

As much as I hate hinduthva propaganda, things why Muslims keep coming in to focus is non compliance for self quarentine after Delhi religious event.

Attending a religious event is not offense or against law..but not cooperating for self quarentine and switching off cell phone going outside radar is what angering people in many states.

Now hindus have fallen victims to modi and bjp and rss. They too will regret. But it would be too late.;When Rakhi Sawant speaks more sense than politicians;Take this with a grain of salt. 

Rakhi Sawant is a deeply fickle person. Often, her comments are simply a function of what would catch the most attention. 

Rakhi was one of the celebrities caught in the sensational Cobrapost exposé of 2018 agreeing to say good things about Modi/BJP in exchange for money. 

She was so excited about the offer that she even did a mock video praising Yogi Adityanath. Video link:

But, if she has really had a genuine change of heart, as slim as the chances of that happening may be, it's a good thing.;Behind the garb of attention whoring, she is actually very smart.

I stayed in Rishikesh for about two weeks. One day I was walking down the street when I was approached by a young guy ~18. He offered me a smoke and a coffee and invited me over to chat, it seemed genuine, they didn’t try to sell me anything. I was introduced to another guy >25 and we all chatted and had a smoke. He asked me about my travel plans and offered travel advice, which I was seeking because I was planning my next move. In fact they had a travel agency, which was next door, but closed at the time and could help me arrange my flights. It seemed legit because there was actually a travel agency next door and I was in a legitimate storefront. So we planned a few flights from the nearby airport to Kashmir>Dharamshala>Delhi. So I gave them the ""deposit"" of ~$50. They then proceeded to invite me over for dinner and gave me a ride back to my place.

 Later that night I was talking to my airbnb host and told him my plans. He tells me I know those f***ers! He tells me, go ahead and go to dinner; have fun, the food will be good, they will get drunk, argue, and offer you some gems. He told me the first plane ticket will work but then you will be stranded and it won’t be worth the time and money to come back to get the guys. 

So with this information I ride my scooter to the apartment to meet them. After debating going straight militant and kicking the door in, I enter and try to act normal. I greeted the two guys from before 18m, 26m and their friend, 22m charismatic , who had invited a couple of girls that he had met. A girl from Michigan, cute, young, and another foreigner I can’t remember her origins, but they are both cute. Anyway, we all cook together, like one person peeled the garlic and another chopped the onions. I didn’t help because I was a little on edge. I’m sitting there thinking, this is all for me, to scam me. The girls, the food, friendliness. I remember noticing how the guy wasn’t very interested in the girls, he had something else on his mind. The girls were there for me.  The food was really good. Then they offered me some whiskey and tried to pressure me into drinking. I firmly declined. The night went on a little bit and the girls had to go. At this point the 26m was getting kinda drunk and started arguing with the other guy. 

Now it was time to talk business. He asked me if I would take some precious gems to the USA and he would give me money but something about a deposit. I snapped. I got up and said give me my money right now you mother fucker. He begged prayer hands “my friend, my friend calm down, my friend, you miss understood” I positioned myself so that my back was to the door. There are two scrawny Indians near me and the third in the kitchen(possible knife situation). I figure if I act violently enough I could probably fuck them all up. I grabbed the 26m by the collar and yoke him up and demanded my money. He says he doesn’t have the money right now and to come to the store tomorrow. I leave the situation and head back to my apartment. Everything my airbnb host predicted came true. One of my biggest regrets in life is not smacking the fuck outa that scammer. It's rare that we get the chance to be so close to such scumbags. 


The next day I go to the storefront and the guy wants to talk, I won’t hear a word of it until I get my money. Finally he gave me my money and I am willing to hear a word. He says “ I never offered you any money” and I just say F**k you and walk out.

So there I was, a typical Indian looking tourist with a backpack from Decathlon walking in a street. A scrawny middle aged dude who looked like a saadhu called at me repeatedly. I didn't want trouble in an unknown place so I went to ask what he wanted.

He was sitting with another similar looking guy and both of them proceeded to roast me for 15 minutes mostly on my skin tone and my physique. Then he tried to force me to buy some random Ayurvedic shit from his stash that would apparently make me fairer. Noped the fuck out of there immediately, though I tried to remain polite.

I have been watching videos about IIT and wanted to begin preparing for it since this is a crucial time to begin but I don't think I can anymore since I am not even able to study for eleventh standard properly.

Just study for what you are in currently. Everything will fall in the way if you study regularly. Good luck.;IAS is after graduation. Get into a good college first. IAS prep can begin in 2nd or 3rd year of college.   
Just one point- see the IAS cut off marks. People fail to get a rank within the top 100 with a difference of just 1-2 marks and that's really bad for a subjective exam, where the same answer will be graded differently by different examiners.   
Personal take- skip the IAS plan for now. If you want to contribute to India's development, join a good private sector company or PSU or startup or start something on your own. The IAS is just a bottleneck for India, and no other country has this archaic method of recruiting bureaucrats based on their knowledge of Pali or History.;Well, to start off... You have time in your hand.. You are just starting 11th and optimistically speaking you have 2 solid years. So don't be depressed just yet! It's ok to feel so and it means you are genuinely motivated to crack IIT! Secondly ,you also mentioned IAS..I presume you are still contemplating between engineering and IAS? If that's the case, first decide that. I'm no expert in IAS prep but I think it has a lot to do with 6th to 12th syllabus. So I would say concentrate on your 11th syllabus for now. Yes, your school not providing online classes is a problem (and you SHOULD contact them regarding the same), but you can start a bit yourself using the books you have... There are plenty of online sources too(Like byju's)! Make a study plan and take it day by day. And while you should aim for IIT's , you should also know there are plenty of other good colleges too! (Not to be complacent.. but you shouldn't pressurise yourself into thinking IIT is the only way.. It doesn't help) prep with whatever you've got and give it your best! As long as you are motivated and dedicated..You'll do well i'm sure! So don't get depressed or panicked.. just take things one at a time.. also, Talk to seniors who have cracked iit for better advice and if you have genuine friends who feel the same as you, talk to them too and plan together;As a student who tried both exams and failed, I think I am better placed to answer this than most. 

**First IIT-** 

Getting into IIT is a matter of hard work. Yes you can be incredibly smart and still get in, but if you work hard, you will surely get in top 1000 rank. 

Getting into IIT is also a insurance policy against the IAS failure (will come back to this point later). If you do manage to get into IIT, rest assured you will earn a decent salary and have a decent life. Ofcourse you will always want more - start the next Flipkart, be the next Raghuram Rajan - but if you step back and compare yourself with the general Indian population, you will feel blessed that you got into IIT. 

Moreover, if you do get into IIT/NIT/BITS you open up a lot of doors. You want to do an MBA - nothing less than IIM. MS- nothing less than a top US college. The possibilities are endless.

**Now, IAS-** 

Getting into IAS is a matter of luck. There are some people who have cleared the exam by brute force of will, hardwork and skill, but these are rare. I have noticed 6 years of candidates and I can name only 2-3 people who truly deserved to clear this exam and who could clear this exam year on year. Most people clear the exam in one year by luck and if they were to write it again, they probably would not. 

I personally know a friend who have given the interview 3 times (he is gave the interview this year but result has been put on hold), cleared the mains 4 times. He is really smart and really hardworking. But his luck runs out at some point or the other - his interview went okay once, his one paper was okay once. So, you cant just bank on the exam. 

The exam is very luck based. Kind of an easier version of getting into the Indian cricket team. For every Kohli who has gotten into the team with hard work, there are even more number of people who couldnt get into India-A team, just because of a bad day, bad weather, bad personal situation etc. *I wouldnt advise you to put all your eggs in the IAS basket.*

**My advise to you**

You should definitely study for IIT now. If you get into any top 50 Engineering college in India, that would be worth it. Even if you fail in UPSC after a couple of attempts, you can give CAT, do an MBA and still have an above average life. This is your insurance which IIT buys. It will buy you peace of mind against the failure of UPSC. 

I know of people who gave UPSC for a couple of year, then went to IIM - A/B/C ( that was 2 years of doing nothing but UPSC btw), went to USA for MS, or just joined a job. IIT helps you with this. 

Also know that only IAS, IPS and IFS are worth the effort. IRS is on par with any job that you might get post IIT, and anything else is plain bad. Either no work, or no power, or too much corruption without the power. So, IIT will help you not take these sub-par options (no offence to anyone who is in those services, but that is just a personal opinion). 

**So, study for IIT now. Forget about IAS. Get into IIT or any other good engineering college. Then you can start to think about IAS.**;This post is soo sharmaji's son;This post is giving me anxiety, even though I have left the IIT phase far behind. Kid, you are just in 11th grade, the earliest you can even give the IAS exam is after 6 years. 6 whole years! Why are you even worrying about something that is so far away? 6 years ago, you were in 5th grade. Are you the same person you were back then? No, right?

In 6 years, you may find out that you have a passion for scientific research or teaching. Hell, you may even find out that you dislike science entirely and pursue something else. Stop worrying about the future and concentrate on the present. Don't forget to enjoy this time as well or else you will only regret later on.

Another thing that really irks me is that people talk about engineering and ias as though they are part of the same career path. Let me clarify something, ias and engineering are completely different! I still remember that when I had finally got admission into a great college after dropping a year, my uncle had said,""Great! You can now prepare for the ias!""

WHY!? Why would I prepare for the ias after going through so much trouble getting into an engineering college? Do you think just getting a degree means you are an engineer?

If you graduate engineering and then stay at home and prepare for ias for two years, your degree would become almost useless by the time you realise that you are not cut out for ias.

Sorry for the rant. This post reminded me about my own experience.

My advise to you would be to work hard but enjoy yourself as well. You will never be a high schooler again. Regret about not getting into an IIT lasts for 8 years but regret about wasting your youth and going into the wrong field lasts for a lifetime.;**IIT** is for engineering.

**IAS** enables you to contribute directly to social upliftment of our country.

**IAS** can be attempted without an IIT degree.

I hope this helps you get some clarity.;Just a little confused. Are your 10th exams already over? My sister's have been postponed so even the timing of entrance to 11th is ambiguous...."

Another thing is I suppose that other incidents have not stopped happening because of the pandemic, so journalists do also need to make sure that other important stories are not being missed because of the lockdown. Considering how flooded all news sources seem to be with coronavirus content though, this might need some work.;If reporting is not done then how will anyone know what actually is going on. Government, cops and rule breaking elements will have free reign to do whatever they want. 

Journalism is a very important tool for people stuck inside their own homes to stay abreast of the actual situation outside and to keep everything in check.;Should Journalists be out covering stories during an War?

The problem lies in adequate protection used by journos during pandemic. They wouldn't stand up in a hail of bullets if reporting in a war zone even when reporting from battle fronts. Thus, adequate caution needs to be exercised during a pandemic too.;>Moreover, excessive reporting on pandemic is creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

They need to keep reporting.  

Issue is 

They are forcing junior reporters without any equipment to cover the stories.

They are going to every location , shoving mikes on the faces of all strangers and interviewing them without maintaining social distancing.  

We saw 4 over enthusiastic journalists went to interview the family of kalburigi covid death. They were all quarantined back then. 


They need to take minimum precautions and need to maintain social distancing while reporting.."

oddcompass,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001DD0D0079C8>,g59jnx,Non-Political,233,"So, I recently did a TON of research and made a video on a man named Malik Ambar.  He's an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion.  What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I wasn't already doing a deep-dive into Deccan history.

His narrative is incredible.

This man was sold into slavery by his own parents, then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire.  Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow.

Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits?

I mean, Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story.  There's the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan, there's the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate, the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island, and more.

Thoughts?

It struck me as particularly strange, as many African communities in India are treated poorly today.  Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories, there would be more respect.

Edit: as people are asking me to post the link here for added visibility, [https://youtu.be/beXIBdLvvPc](https://youtu.be/beXIBdLvvPc).","Why aren't there movies made about important African (Habshi) figures in Indian history? In general, there seems to be so little discussion of Africans and their important historical role in India.",0.94,"1. It's a regional empire - most regional histories are underweighted, ignored  in India. This is a major factor

2. It's not particularly resonant with existing state governments and parties in power.  eg maharashtra is shivaji this and shivaji that. No particular state takes up some of these stories now like the sultanate

3. It is not super recent.  History in itself is not told well, except as lip service, rote elements, fables, vague allusions to great indian past/ history, or injustice done by brits , etc etc . Few people really take to studying history.

4. It doesn't bespeak any broad trends in history - eg colonialism, nation state etc.

5. Malik Amber, on the face of it doesn't scream african or escaped slavery background.

There are a lot of people with interesting stories in history whose stories could be told.

If you can tell his story in an interesting fashion, you *should* try.;Racism could be a reason seeing how they are treated in society today.

PS. You should post that video you made.;For those interested, here's the episode on Malik Amber from [Sunil Khilnani's Incarnations on BBC Radio 4](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05wy644);Although sometimes light or salaciously written, Manu Pillai's books talk about some of these figures. That was the first time I ever heard of Malik Ambar, check it out - https://www.amazon.in/Rebel-Sultans-Deccan-Khilji-Shivaji/dp/9386228734

He also had an engrossing episode or two on The Seen and The Unseen podcast -  https://seenunseen.in/episodes/2018/12/10/episode-98-the-deccan-before-shivaji/;Modern India is basically an empire consolidated by the Mughals, then captured by the British and now ruled by the elites of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh after the divisions.

Empires are known for trying to suppress regionalism by glorifying some selected part of history and culture while ignoring others. The narrative is set by the elites who control the key powers.

The history of the Habshi is not important in the grand scheme of things and so was ignored. There are many such fascinating events and characters in our history which are kept under shadow.

For example, how much people know about Gopal, the founder of the Pala empire who was elected by the people as the king of Bengal?;Also the Siddis of Janjira. Perhaps the only unconquered fort in medieval to modern times. They successfully defended that island fort against full might of Marathas and Europeans alike.;Definitely think it's racism. Because I feel that Indians are kinda racist to everyone but white people.;Isn't Habshi a slur?;History in general is extremely vast. And for a place like India that has such diversity and immense depth, you're bound to have thousands of stories and people left out of the popular narrative. Regional histories are ignored for the most part in Indian curriculum. The stories told by family and local art forms/movies were our only sources of regional history, even to this day in most places.;Yea we got the video in recommendation too.;If there were movies, the actors would be accused of blackface.

Because there is no way we'd get ""dark-skinned"" actors to do those roles :(;OP thanks for making such an awesome video .What are those dashed lines in map near Chhattisgarh , which empire was that ? 

Link to that point : [https://youtu.be/beXIBdLvvPc?t=362](https://youtu.be/beXIBdLvvPc?t=362);There are two areas in Hyderabad that were granted by the nizam to his African troops: habsi guda and AC guards.

Integration of the African origin communities could be the answer to India's Olympic struggles.

 ""In 1987, the Sports Authority of India (SAI), spearheaded by the then Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sport Margaret Alva, began initial efforts to set up a sports scheme to scout and train members of the community....However, the ‘Special Area Games Scheme’ was discontinued six years later in 1993 leaving members of the community who enrolled for the programme stranded. ""

I have read a lot about Malik Ambar, and the way he rallied Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, and Golconda against the Mughals is epic!

[**YASMEEN SERHAN**](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/yasmeen-serhan/)

For much of the world, the coming weeks and months ([if not years](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/)) will be dedicated to curbing the spread of the coronavirus. In China, where the outbreak has purportedly been contained, another challenge is pressing: Damage control.

Beijing has been mounting a diplomatic push to help the world contain the pandemic and, in the process, reposition itself not as the authoritarian power that was slow to sound the alarm on the impending health crisis, but as the global leader that stepped up when [others didn’t](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/trump-threatens-defund-world-health-organization/610030/). In some places, it appears [to](https://shanghaiist.com/2020/03/25/serbian-president-kisses-chinese-flag-after-experts-and-equipment-arriving-from-china/) [be](https://www.lastampa.it/politica/2020/03/24/news/il-pd-attacca-di-maio-troppo-filo-cinese-1.38633410) [working](https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1250608378797326337?s=20).

Not everywhere, though. In India, which this month marked 70 years of diplomatic relations with Beijing, anti-China sentiment has soared. Many Indians fault the country for allowing the virus’s spread, and references to the “Wuhan virus” and “China virus” have become commonplace.

India’s perception of China at this moment matters, if for no other reason than to signal how others might be viewing Beijing’s efforts. Like many countries, India doesn’t count China as a key ally, nor does it necessarily have much incentive to praise Beijing for its response to the pandemic so far. India is, however, also among the many countries that have become reliant on China—not just for trade and investment, which was the case before the pandemic, but, perhaps most crucially now, for the vital equipment required to curb the spread of the virus, including testing kits, face masks, and other personal protective gear. That dependence has proved enough to prevent India from openly criticizing China—at least in any official capacity. It hasn’t stopped the Indian public from turning on Beijing, though, nor is it likely to prevent other countries’ populations from doing the same.

If India proves impervious to its charitable efforts, China might wonder, who else will?

India has always had a complicated relationship with its larger neighbor. Though India was the first country in Asia outside the Communist bloc to establish diplomatic ties with the People’s Republic of China, in April 1950, their shared history has been riddled with tensions—not least a war (which China won) and an [unresolved border](https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/05/are-china-and-india-about-to-fight-over-their-border/275518/) dispute in Arunachal Pradesh, Indian’s northeasternmost state. Compounding these divisions are India’s tensions with its bitter rival Pakistan (an ally of China’s) and other long-standing issues such as the status of Kashmir, a disputed territory between India and Pakistan to which China also lays some territorial claim. But India and China also share a number of common interests, including a robust, if [lopsided](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=199141), trading relationship.

“The India-China relationship has had its ups and downs,” Gautam Bambawale, India’s ambassador to China from 2017 to 2018, told me. He noted that officials on both sides tend to describe the relationship as one “where there are elements of both cooperation as well as competition.” Others have described the two countries as “[frenemies](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/world-can-learn-from-frenemies-india-china-akbaruddin/articleshow/63413235.cms).”;So in that case the US and Trump should be part of the problem because Trump also played it down, claimed it was a hoax, and just the common flu and would go away by April with warmer weather, and now he is literally instigated rednecks to protest against stay at home orders. What he has done is 10000000000000000 times worse than anything China allegedly did"

Red zones will extend lockdowns. Places like Mumbai, Indore (and I hope even Bhopal) will be too difficult to control if they lift any restrictions as people don't really give a fuck about the disease, they are at homes only because the Police is beating them.


For green zones they will open most of the factories and industries, with an asterisk that if a new case pops up everything shuts down in that area again. 

Not sure how the govt will manage the orange zones. Because our testing is still so low, opening up those zones can lead to an exponential increase in new cases which will be extremely hard to trace.;Further Extension with minor reliefs.;Different parts of India will continue to go on and off the lockdown for another few months as new cases emerge"

Hey Everyone,

I am bored out of my mind. Since I have experience in the Personal Care Appliance industry, so thought of creating this post to help the first time trimmer buyers in Quarrantine. I have tested all of these products at one time or the other. This seems like a need for many of the people in the male demographic

Note : Only the products which are deliverable will be featured. Currently only Flipkart is delivering so I am only featuring Flipkart Products. Will edit this post later to include

3. Hair Clippers - To Trim and cut your hair when you are at Home

**Detailed Analysis**

**Beard Trimmer**

**Economy Segment**

[Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Rs 1199 v/s [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Rs 1349

Spec Wise & Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings & IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time & 11 length settings

Product quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched

Decision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi

**Premium Segment**

[Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Rs 1999 Best Personal care product to have been launched last year. As close to a shave as you can get.

Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition

**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**

Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits

**Economy Segment**

[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299

Decent Specs : 45 min run time & 21 Length settings

5 Attachments - Beard Trimmer, Body Groomer, Nose & Ear Trimmer, Precision Trimmers, Body grooming Comb

No competition in this price range. Product is good reviews are great

**Premium Segment**

[Nova 1153](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3) Rs 1599 v/s [Syska 3052](https://www.flipkart.com/syska-ht3052k-02-runtime-50-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97a98575ca758?pid=TMRFGYCDZ2FA3DFZ) Rs 1599

Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones

My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052

**Hair Clippers**

Most of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now

[Nova NHT 1083](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) \- Newer Product with decent Specs 120 min run time. 5 Length Settings for hair. Reviews and ratings are good

~~One blade doesn't have rechargeable battery~~;Mi Trimmer is the worst. It looks good on paper spec wise. When it comes to getting the job done, it falls short. It gives a shoddy cut. It doesn't matter if it charges quick if it doesn't give one a good cut. So steer away from Mi Trimmer;Can you suggest something good that doesn't require maintenance, like oiling and clean up every few months?;This is absolutely amazing. Thanks.;Great! Would like to see your reviews once everything is available in stock.;If you can get your hand on it, I would hands down recommend the Panasonic ER240 BP.

It is one of the rare no nonsense trimmers I've seen. I've been using them since my teens. 

Maintenance is very low, you need two AA batteries (I put rechargeable Eneloops) and they're effective for body grooming as well.

Trust me guys, you won't go wrong with it. 

It's available on Flipkart and Amazon by third party sellers now. Used to be for 1500-1700.

Now it's for 2300-2500.;can someone explain the difference between trimmer and a clipper.;Thanks op;For someone who haven't used a hair clipper before, how much skills do you need to use that thing. Would the outcome be decent or is it better to just wait it out and visit a barber. I don't have any specific style when cutting and visits regular barber for haircut and not fancy salons if that helps.;Which is the best hair clipper from whal or any other but should be long lasting. What would you recommend.;Thanks for putting this up! I would have gone for the one blade, but it only supports length till 5mm. I have the old philips that supports length of 10mm, and I'm finding that insufficient.

What trimmer would you suggest to groom and keep a bigger beard? With 10mm I'm forced to trim it more than I want.;I have a Wahl Hair Cutting Clipper. I can cut my hair from the behind using a mirror, I can cut the front hairs using a scissor, but the middle hairs are extremely difficult. 

Anyone know how to cut them? If I use the clipper it seems like it will practically make me bald, and scissors seem extremely inconsistent"

His earnings tripled, and he said he got 25k every month for 12 hours of work, which is not much but better than the 8-10k he got earlier. He can make more trips and do it faster. The e-rickshaw he had was a jugaad and cost him around 40k.

I wonder if the use of basic tech can make India's unorganized workforce more productive.   
Another example is that of the domestic help in many houses. Most domestic help still use a broom stick to get the dust out, and crawl on the floor with a cloth mop and a bucket to mop it, I wonder how long this archaic practice will persist. The world has moved to vacuum cleaners to remove dust and to high-tech mops with spray nozzles to wipe the floor effortlessly.   
Imagine how tired the domestic help gets after sitting and crawling on a floor throughout your house.   
When I lived in another part of the world, I saw cleaners were truly professional. They brought a portable vacuum, mop, liquids etc. They cleaned the entire house in around 1 hour, and they charged about $40 for it. They did about 8-10 houses in a day and earned a good living.   
That made me wonder why we don't use technology to help the unorganized sector employees become more productive.   
I think that a lot of the manual work and its pain in India is because we don't invest in basic technologies to improve productivity. The labor class has a perception that technology will displace jobs, which is not true. It just enables them to do more work with the same effort and earn better. The employers think that tech is expensive and can break etc. That's also not true. Basic tech is not expensive, and payback is usually in months, not years.

The only , THE ONLY silver lining is that despite inadequate testing , repeated lockdown violations etc at the very least till now the death rate / mortality rate in india combined with the number of SARI cases has been really really small. I don't know why, no one knows why but some unknown factor might be working in our favor , it might just be the lockdown tbh but who knows tropical heat (yes I know it hasn't been proved but it also hasn't been disproved yet because studies are going to take time), maybe it's because of BCG vaccinations, maybe the younger population, maybe inherently stronger immunity towards Coronaviruses (the family of viruses not the one causing Covid19) etc .

We were to be proved wrong soon enough and we know them as palm civets. Palm civets are a strange bunch of mammals with tails that look like that of the cats. 

We now know that these one of the civets entered our house and crapped all over our kitchen. We initially thought it was a rat until we caught a juvenile palm civet in a trap. I rode to a place full of trees without many people around and released the animal there.

The animal is now separate from its family and probably hiding somewhere. Knowing my parents, they would have had the animal killed merely out of fear. Now, I need to know if I did it right.

&#x200B;

Until airlines are flying again, there is no way most visitors are leaving India and hence your grandma should be ok. 

You probably need to apply for an extension online at the right time, just go ahead and do it. Do keep the receipt of the application.;First off, sorry you're going through this. It's a tough situation. I hope your grandma has somewhere safe to stay while she's in India. 

Does New Zealand not do repatriation? 

And do you have any evidence, either a written statement or screenshot or recording, of the message that you can only apply two days beforehand? 

What I would personally do is see if there is an email for the embassy and put it in writing that you are getting this message that you have to wait two days and will be abiding by that as per the instructions given to you. 

Most likely, India won't allow international flights until June and will automatically extend the visa, but just in case you face any trouble later, it's better to have documentation that you tried to follow their policies.;Chilax, visa will be extended.;I thought that NZ arranged 2 or 3 flights from India this week.;Don't worry. Right now focus on keeping her safe from Corona. Visa can wait. Relax. Come back here if you face any issues. Someone here will definitely help you if the need arises."

I've been having some problems down there. I can't seem to be able to fully pull down my foreskin and I don't know how to explain it to my parents. I don't know if I should see a doctor about it or not. And I'm a little worried they might have to perform a circumcision on me. I really need your advice to talk to my parents about this  


Thanks for reading","The good ol' avoiding sex talk in Indian society because we're too ""pure"" for that ideology has affected me today and I need your advice",0.86,"In many cases it will “pull back” by itself following sexual intercourse or pulling back the foreskin by hand. If it doesn’t there may be underlying conditions like [phimosis](https://www.webmd.com/men/phimosis-paraphimosis) which cause problems and that requires medical intervention.

There’s no way to remotely diagnose anyone properly, so *you should see a doctor asap* once lockdown is over. I realise it’s embarrassing, so maybe ask a friend, family friend, or discreet cousin to help you. I’m not sure which specialism will help, but an experienced general practitioner or urologist could be your first port of call.;If you’ve severe case of phimosis where you can’t retract foreskin to the back, you need to consult a doctor, circumcision isn’t always required or the only solution. So, don’t worry, consult a doctor first.Usually, phimosis can be common with kids but goes away before you enter puberty at age 12-13. Adult phimosis can be corrected with both stretching exercises and surgeries.

Here’s the important part, you’re supposed to clean your glans under your foreskin every-time you bathe, if you’ve never cleaned it, it’ll cause more complications.

[here’s something you should definitely read.](https://np.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/arh3qu/tifu_by_not_washing_under_my_foreskin_for_the/);Okay so, so here's my advice, go to a urologist, according to the severeness he/she would prescribe what to do,mostly it ends up in circumcision, byfar the best type of circumcision is zsr method, but it costs around 30k,but there are cheaper alternatives, honestly go see a doctor, coz if you don't, it's gonna be really painful in the future.;It could be Phimosis or just a case of your foreskin being too taut.

There are a few easy home procedures that can help loosen the foreskin and help it slide back.

This is by dipping your penis in lukewarm water (something that's comfortable on the skin), apply some oil (go for something as simple as coconut or vegetable oil) and pull back the skin as much as you can. Keep repeating this for a few minutes, every day. You could do this while taking a shower. This should be relatively easy and not much painful on a flaccid penis if you don't have a serious case of Phimosis.

However, if it gets painful you should visit a doctor and get a circumcision done. It's a normal procedure so don't worry.

Being an Asian student, the NUS business school is almost a dream come true for me. In any other time, I'd be astronomically excited to join the college and persue my degree.

  


  


  


But situation as it is, COVID-19 means that I am now in a dilemma because of 2 reasons -

  


1. Most politicians and Economists agree that even after the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, the recession it has started will continue. Does this mean that this is not the best time to be graduating from a business school?

  


2. Due to ban on international travel laid down by most countries, I may not be able to travel and attend classes physically. Being able to immerse myself in a developed Aisan work culture and the ability to network with some.of the best students from all around ASIA is one of the reasons why I am persuing the degree and studying for online while living in India is not worth the money I'll be paying for the MBA for me.

I need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. 

Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar.

Today, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request for my account and that I needn't worry. On myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.

But I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.

Is there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?

Here's some background information: 

  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 

2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 

3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   


  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   


  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? I really love the girl, and do genuinely want to marry her, but the difference in cultures is a roadblock, and it is so frustrating sometimes. If it wasn't so time sensative, I could wait, but we are out of time for me to be super super patient.","So, I'm an American dating a South Indian, and I need some advice",0.84,"Every human being is different, so please take my generalized advice with a pinch of salt:


There's a strong division in Indian society between what is public and what is private. Please know that these conceptions are not universal and do not overlap exactly with American ideas. In many Indian communities, dating is now common in the younger generation, but telling your family about a significant other = an engagement. So in an Indian context, for many people, its putting the cart before the horse to announce the relationship prior to an engagement.  
If your relationship is strong in every other way, a reluctance to tell the extended family does not signify a lack of belief in it on her part. Assuming your relationship is in good shape in every other way, she isn't ""hiding behind"" Indian culture, she's doing her best to balance her family's worldview with your worldview, and this takes time and effort. Many people who have to inhabit multiple worlds go through this process. 

Perhaps one way to proceed is to get on her team, become her partner and ally in negotiating between cultures. After all, once you marry an Indian, you've joined the wild and subtle dance of inhabiting multiple cultures for life, my friend.  So ask questions, something like:

- What does your family think about X?
- What can we do to set them at ease about X?
- How can we communicate to them that XYZ is important to me/us?
- What is important to them / what are their concerns about X?

Get yourselves on the same team, so that you're not another node in the cultural tug-of-war. 

Once more, every person and every relationship is unique, and so is every family, so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt.;Dude. I’m an Indian girl engaged to a non indian, and half my family still doesn’t know. Trust me, it’s less drama this way.;Ask her if her mom is against the extended family knowing. How does she plan to break the news of the marriage to them? How old are you both?;I'm from Coimbatore and it's still a very conservative place compared to other big cities. Her reservations about revealing about you to her family could be because of two reasons. Most families here are not very encouraging of love marriages and doubly so when it's interracial. She may be holding off because she doesn't want the extended family making unwanted remarks about her relationship. It is not unusual for the family to reveal to others in the extended family about the relationship only after the wedding dates are set. In a conservative South Indian set up there's only courting no dating. 

Also she may not be very sure of what the future holds especially since you guys may end up living in different cities. And if it doesn't work out, if she has to get an arranged marriage then if her extended family knows about a prior relationship with an American her value in the arranged marriage market goes down.;You need to ask yourself this first. Is it really necessary for you to want her extended family to know about you?
Over here in some conservative communities , extended family will poke their huge noses in EVERY matter. I'm not exaggerating by any means. It is a nuisance . Imagine them calling you everyday and asking why you don't have kids and then making fun of you for not being a ""man"" and earning more than his wife. They will berate you . Your partner is aware of that and is trying to tread carefully here . So understand her side, know that this is a serious situation and give her time to deal with this . Also take some time to brush up on her family politics lol;A lot of Indian families are very close knit, children (even after 18) are close with their parents and often support them financially too. Parents too support their children, emotionally and financially.

Here are a few things you need to consider.
- Find out how close is she to her family
- How orthodox is her family, immediate most importantly.

If she's really close and is from an orthodox family, you're definitely in for trouble. Reason being it's quite likely they would want an arrangement within the faith and even possibly the same language. That being said, if she's not really close she may still be okay going against their wishes. But if she is really close, 99% chance she will not go against their wishes.;Though you've probably been told this, marrying someone from another country, heck, even just a slightly different community then your own is a HUGE deal in India. Having a job and being independent would give her more standing and give her decisions (like deciding to marry you) more weight and respect in the community. My cousin was dating his gf for about 6 years (who was also from India but from a different state) before he told his parents because he was waiting to get a good job. When I told my parents about my girlfriend who was Indian but was Christian, there were fights and tears for several months and my own mother couldn't talk to me for an entire month. This despite the fact that we're comparatively a very progressive family, with several relatives including myself living abroad. And all this is exponentially harder for a girl because India is still quite patriarchal and women asserting their independence can cause major freakouts. 

So please realise that this isn't about YOU. You don't have to convince her of anything or explain to her how important it is to you etc etc. She already knows all these things. And she agrees with all these things. She is on your side. However, the careful manoeuvres required to inform parents and extended family... Leave those decisions to her. She has taken the first steps which is telling her sister and her mother. My guess is her mother is still getting acclimatized to the idea. And before she tells her father she would need her mother's support. If mother's support is there, even if her father gets upset she (your gf) will have someone on the inside (her mom) to placate him. Otherwise things could get ugly fast. 

Again it's not about you at all. It's unfortunate that Indian families are like this. But these tight family bonds lead to a much more supportive, connected and loving family structure once all this blows over and you won't regret it. It's just that some people are old fashioned and need some time to come to terms with big changes. All their life her parents probably had ideas on what her wedding would be like or what kind of groom they will find for her and they have to suddenly make a 180 on the things they've simply believed all their lives.

Similar issues will arise when her parents want to tell the rest of the family. There are a lot of things they will consider. Things like timing and maybe first slowly introducing the idea that she's dating someone without revealing who it is. They may also want to go in person to have this discussion. In the case in my family each move was very carefully planned and we aren't even particularly close or dependant on the extended family. 

If you want to make things easier for her, make some efforts to understand her culture. Learn a bit of the language, buy some traditional Indian clothes (with her help!). Read up on Indian history so you better understand the context of some things. And make sure to support her when she starts facing push back (which she 100% will) from her family and extended family. People may say awful things about her to her face, stuff that makes her cry. Your job is NOT to get angry at that moment or say something like ""fuck those guys how dare they say that"" and try and break away from the family. Instead be patient and give it time, lots of time. Be like a river that carves its way through a canyon. Just with patience and time you can win over even the most conservative folks in her family. But she has to be the one taking these decisions on how to move the needle forward. Just trust her and wait. About the job thing, there isn't anything extra you can do. She knows it's important too, but far more important things are on the line, lifelong family relationships and she definitely has to prioritize that. If she messes it up, both the job and the relationships get fucked. She must be smart enough to know that this stuff is time sensitive, she's struggling with these decisions as well. I can't imagine there is anything you can tell her she hasn't thought of already.;I am a guy who is born and bred in [Coimbatore.In](https://Coimbatore.In) the last 4-5 years,i am seeing comparatively a lot more Indian guys/girls are getting married to non indians than ever before.Chill,my only advice is to let her know how much she means to you .Don't fret too much about being being accepted to her extended family and let her""the coming out"" part to her.

One tip is once things get settled ,get a hang of things what you can say or not to say from [her.In](https://her.In) India,typically value if your parents have had a strong and long relationship and fret if you have step moms/dads taking it as a sign of you not being brought up properly or not marriage material.Another one,is fold your hands and greet elders with a ""Vanakkam"" for extra brownie points;I'm dating a non-indian so maybe I can offer some perspective. I've met his family. Several times. They were very sweet people and we loved each other a lot. Nobody in my family is even aware of his existence. I cannot even begin to imagine the drama if I tell them. I am pretty serious about him, and I do plan to tell them someday once my bf gets a job and settles down but for now? I definitely don't wanna deal with that bc Indian parents + relatives are The Most annoying people on the planet. 

It's not a you problem it's a them problem. It's better off that you tell them as late as possible once everything (like ur wedding date etc) is set, or better yet, not tell them at all. 

Tbqh, I don't hold my relatives in high regard and I'd prefer they never knew of my boyfriend even after he becomes my husband. It does create some friction that he's never met anybody on my side, but I do try to emphasize that these people don't matter that much to me. Maybe u should consider why it's so important to you that her family needs to know about you. Like I get it if u have a really good relationship with ur family, and maybe she doesn't get along with hers.

I would love to help u.
All Indian parents wants their kids to be merried into thier own culture ( mostly with same level family). Because, for most of the people here in India their cast, name and traditions play very much important role. People here thinks that for foreigners marriage is like a just play. Because, in America people usually have relationship outside their marriage and can take divorce at any time...
**(Asia has a more divorce rate compare to USA)
Most of their concern is foreign countries culture that they are practicing..and fact is that
 India's metropolitan cities are  also on the same track.. trying to copy all the things what other developed nation likes like live in relationship, intercourse before merraige and divorce..
Still in 21 century in India, there are so many topics that still considers taboo or not publicly open...
(Don't take it personally...)
But at the last, I would say. If u really truly love this girl and won't leave her hand till ur last breath. Then just go to her parents and tell them. U are the only person who will love her more than her father and she would be happy and secure with u. U won't let her down at any point of her life. 
(Tips: start taking interest in their traditions) 
All the best for u.;Would it help to know that she is biding her time to reveal your existence in such a way, that she could actually get her dad to agree to the engagement/marriage ?

Would it help to know that most Indians parents will be very wary of Americans because of the stereotypical American divorces ?

Looking at your academic histories, you are around 22 and she is around 24. What is your hurry to get engaged or married ?  You will have to explain more about why this is so 'time sensitive'. 

Engagements in the US are not half as serious as engagements in India. So my advice is to calm down and give her some time.

\[BTW - you keep talking about being an American and not being able to understand Indian family politics. Think of you bringing a black/white/muslim/jew whatever to the thanksgiving table and telling everyone that you are getting married\];Yeah all that hiding behind indian culture is all BS.

But I can't understand, if you guys are in a hurry and she really wants to marry you, whats taking her so long. 
The worst case scenario is her American relatives saying no, or they may help her but not you or they may help both of you. 
If her parents have agreed to your marriage, It's less likely that her American family will deny the stay.;Sounds pretty shady to me, man - the whole not telling to other than parents and stuff. Just shows the lack of courage. 

I think you need to have a direct talk about how things are going to done and handled by her. Ask her questions and get down to playing different scenarios and stuff. And don't give in to the ""will think about it later or I don't want to think about it now"" answers, it's just another way of saying I don't have the courage to do it now. Set a deadline for her to give you answers.

Edit: And Vanakkam ( that's Tamil);Her reasoning is simple: If this relationship doesn't work and end up in marriage, she will be humiliated. She might not even get good marriage proposals if she wants to go the arranged marriage route later. Her concerns are valid. You won't lose much if this relationship doesn't work out(except the heartbreak), but if she wants to maintain a dignified image before her extended family, she has to think pragmatically.;Advice ille;[removed]"

1. The  strix g I am looking at comes with a 1TB HHD. Does it have M.2 SSD slot  as well so I can add one ssd later? Maybe I will go with a 512GB SSD if  the price drops a little bit.

3. Asus  rog strix g doesn't come with a camera. I usually don't use camera in  India but I am going to college outside India and I don't want to carry  an extra accessory with the already heavy laptop. So, I need a camera  inbuilt if at all possible. Lastly,

I have a proposal I would like to put up for validation, so some of us may be familiar with the term ""Socratic method"", for those who are not, it is the way of teaching where you induce curiosity into the pupil's mind, it works on the assumption that all knowledge is innate within us and just requires to be brought out. I have been an avid practitioner and long time beneficiary of this technique. It has not only helped me learn the oddest of concepts (I am a law student, I have to study a lot of odd bizarre topics) but teach them with success as well. Basically it's all about leading the child in right direction of thought, it's about teaching the student how to think instead of what to think. In my opinion, this allows for greater actual learning and less rote learning. I was thinking about it and thought about having some insight from Indian parents and students before going ahead and taking on the challenge to build a platform to facilitate this.

no thanks.;Asking the right questions, being objective and prioritizing properly is the right approach. More people should start taking this approach all over the world.

There are **four possible explanations**:

1. The epidemic may have struck later than in other countries. Since epidemics have exponential growth at the start, a small delay can have massive effects on the number of cases.
2. India’s 21-day lockdown may have successfully suppressed the epidemic. Physical distancing is one of the best ways to slow the epidemic and, if anything, many have criticized the lockdown for being too draconian in that regard.
3. India has not been able to test enough to count all cases and deaths. Without sufficient testing, many deaths may not be labeled with Covid-19 for official statistics, leading to an underestimation of the severity of the crisis.
4. India may have protective characteristics against Covid-19. Researchers have proposed that the low share of elderly in the population, the high temperatures and humidity in India, widespread BCG vaccination for tuberculosis, or resistance to malaria have helped India escape the brunt of the pandemic."

It is one of the solutions to try to flatten the curve, to delay the spread. Lockdown has economic impact and a big one. 

In my view, a prudent approach needs to be followed, allowing important industries to start bit by bit, carrying on testing, locking down hotspots, providing for the most vulnerable population while as citizens we try our best to stay at home (go out only on need basis or once in a while), avoid gatherings and maintain social distancing as much as we can.;This is what I have been saying since the beginning of the lockdown. The point of a lockdown is to do massive scale testing which we aren't close to doing not even in states like Maharashtra. So basically, you go into lockdown, you identify and contact trace clusters, these communities are tested at atleast 50k per day . Eventually some communities can be reopened with strick quarantines for infected people. This is done in phases till the lockdown is absolutely taken down. 

India doesn't nearly have the capacity to test that many people. Without mass testing I don't know how they plan to reopen the lockdown, we can't stay in a lockdown forever or we might as well sell off our economy. It takes one infected person to attend office or something akin to that to start a second outbreak in a country as densely populated as India.

He will update me as and when he can, but for the moment has support and that's really what matters.

NOTE:- For clarification he is not from Karnataka but has been brought up over there for most of his life. His parents had to abruptly leave and go back to Rajashthan without giving him any prior notice (returned to his native place, ie Rajasthan). 

The mentioned event took place just a few days before lockdown was imposed so he was left for stranded and that's where OP's text post takes over in context/story.

He's in Hubli Karnataka, and is on his way to a different city 80km away from his location (as of 7AM). I was able to get in touch with him via my cell phone. (I do not live in Karnataka)

A good friend of the OP has offered to provide him shelter where his house is located. He did have something to eat last night, slept in the railway station.

He has attempted to contact the police to get some help, but they simply suggested him to just get a lift from a lorry truck/milk service van to hitch a ride up to his destination.

He spent his last days fasting for a clean Ganga in 2018. He died after 112 days.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prof. G. D. Agarwal, alma mater IIT Roorkee UC Berkeley, died from a fast-unto-death to protest against environmentally destructive projects on Ganga and Bhagirathi .

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._D._Agrawal#2018

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/12/indian-environmental-activist-fasts-death-over-fate-indias-ganges-river/

He was extremely vocal against illegal river sand mining.

Corporates with investments in infrastructure and resort tourism projects were at risk due to his activism. 

With proper media followup, he would have definitely succeeded in galvanizing public opinion for halting these environmentally destructive projects.

I strongly feel diktat has been given from top to media to stop his legacy from reaching out to common man.This must be the fucking reason why he is not newsworthy to our media.

Why do you think mainstream media wants us to focus on Timur ?

This poor man wanted nothing more but to see the ecosystem to be safe. That's an amazing selfless goal and there's nothing wrong with that.

But there are multiple ways to spread the word without having to succumb to starvation, which is a horrible way to die.

I'm sure this is not the full story, there's probably other reasons for his fasting.

But assuming his reason was to bring awareness to this issue in the eyes of the public, who already turn a blind eye to the poverty stricken that starve everyday and die a worthless death, one more death will not matter to them.;That didn't help the cause, did it? Sometimes, to do something substantial you gotta adapt. A man of his intellect and determination, could've contributed a lot more then just sit on a protest. Kudos to him though. 👍🏽;I am sorry but this is some Ikiru level thing. I respect him for his intention and nothing can take away that . But He should have known that Fasting was not going to solve the problem atleast in 2018 . There are a lot of ways to make a statement but fasting to death is not it . For example the mumbai man who fills pot holes himself , because one of it killed his son . No, he did not fast to death to get govt act on it .

What he did was profoundly moving to those of us who hold the same values. His conscience led him to do what he did. Who are we to pass judgements?

### Tl;dr

On 31 March, the Foundation for Media Professionals filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis. During the first hearing on 9 April, the Court issued notice to the Standing Counsel for Government of Jammu & Kashmir. The matter was listed again today i.e. 21 April and the Court directed the Government to file a reply to the petition by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March. The petition was first listed for hearing before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J on 9 April. During the hearing on 9 April, the bench issued notice to the Standing Counsel of Government of Jammu & Kashmir. Read more about the petition and last hearing [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/sc-issues-notice-in-fmps-petition-seeking-restoration-of-4g-internet-services-in-jammu-kashmir-during-covid-19-crisis/).

Subsequent to the petition being filed on 31 March, the Government of Jammu & Kashmir continued to direct ISPs to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G through orders issued under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. These orders issued on 3 April and 15 April were also challenged by the Petitioner by filing additional applications. 

### Practical Impact of the Internet Slowdown

In addition to challenging subsequent internet slowdown orders, the Petitioner also sought to bring on record personal narratives of hardships faced by doctors, teachers, students, journalists, advocates etc in Jammu & Kashmir due to the internet slowdown. FMP’s Director and veteran journalist, Ms. Revati Laul personally spoke to 13 residents of Jammu & Kashmir to collect these narratives.

>*“I have so many patients who are just able to call me this time. I can’t understand what they are trying to tell me exactly...One said,I have pain in the tummy. The tummy is big. It has around 20 organs inside. So then I ask – is it the upper part of the tummy, is it the right side, is it lower? And it becomes very difficult. It’s not possible to accurately pin-point what they’re saying.”* \-Doctor at Srinagar Government Medical College on need for video facilities  
>  
>*“The universities will hold their exams on time. Then no one will speak on our behalf to say to them – oh, there was no 4G, there were no classes. There will only be exams. Did we get any education? Are teachers being sent to our homes? Is there a door to door drive to ensure that students’ education won’t be affected?""* \- Student at Degree College in Bemina

The Petitioner also produced a comparative analysis of web performance at 2G and 4G speed to help the Court fully understand the practical consequences of the internet slowdown. This technical report was authored by Mr. Prateek Waghre, a technologist and policy researcher who had previously also analysed functionality of whitelisted websites in Jammu & Kashmir. The analysis revealed that tasks on observed 2G speed can take upto 50 times longer and 2G network conditions were well below the minimum requirements of video streaming/video communication platforms like YouTube, Zoom and Skype. In addition to this theoretical analysis, Mr. Waghre also carried out a simulated test which found that some interactive interfaces like the World Health Organization’s Situation Tracker did not function at observed 2G speeds at all. 

### What happened at today’s hearing?

During today’s hearing, the bench inquired about a suo moto petition pending before the Jammu & Kashmir High Court on the same issue. In response to this, the Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta indicated that he requires time to seek more information about the suo moto petition and suggested that it may also be transferred to the Supreme Court. 

The Court also sought information about the total number of COVID-19 cases in Jammu & Kashmir. Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for FMP informed the Court that the region had 354 COVID-19 cases. He emphasized that this was a matter of grave urgency and the Government had not filed its response despite notice being issued on 9 April. Therefore, he requested the Court to direct the Government to file its reply expeditiously.

The Attorney General, Mr. KK Venugopal sought to justify the internet slowdown by claiming that the region had a serious militancy problem. However, the bench directed the Government to file a proper written response and record its submissions on affidavit. The Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta accepted this direction and indicated that the Government will file a consolidated report. 

In addition to FMP’s petition, two more petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet services filed by Soayib Quereshi and Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir were also listed for hearing today. Advocate Charu Ambwani representing the Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir highlighted how the education of 27 lakh students was being hampered because they did not have access to high speed internet. In response to a question by the bench, she also stated that most students in Jammu & Kashmir have laptops and tablets so the biggest hurdle is slow internet speed. 

After hearing submissions made by all counsels, the bench directed the Government to file a reply by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April.

>The Quint that the authorities acted in haste without proper preparation. “Police or the BBMP didn’t contact any local leaders before taking this step. The decision was taken in a hurry. People are already worried because of the messages they are receiving on social media. Instead of coming with buses to take people, they should have taken the help local MLAs or community leaders to explain the decision to the people,” he said.

They did this at night suddenly without informing the people. Showing up at night to take some random people to quarantine centre which people are already fearful of without telling them in advance is idiotic.

The administration should communicate effectively through local MLAs of when and where and why they are taking them to quarantine.;we should give people the benefit of doubt and not dehumanise them. Kerala has 28% muslim population, the earliest case of covid, had 300 jamaatis return to the state and has migrant labour and NRI huge numbers. Yet only 2 deaths and single figure new cases now.

This is a bjp state, like most where these incidents occur. Police are thrashing people left right and centre. Activists are being arrested. Lynch mobs roam with impunity. Hate speech by senior ruling party figures goes unpunished. Quarantine centres are badly run. Testing is low. A 3000+ gathering is maligned and demonised disproportionately, while all around political rallies,metro trains, offices, flights were running. Community transmission is denied, while the entire responsibility of the virus spread is being put on a scapegoated community

&#x200B;

Thank You.","Relevance of Udemy courses in the job sector, particularly IT.",0.91,"Most certificates from Udemy/Coursera/EdX are not worth shit

What you learnt, how challenging it was and how you applied what you learnt is useful.;Don't do the courses just to show your certifications, create and add projects to your CV(add it to your LinkdIn too) using your newly learned skills. Projects do a better job showcasing your skills than a course certification because employers can actually see your code if you upload it on Github.;Udemy certifications are self help kind, good to learn but has no impact in your cv. Go for coursera and do a course from a reputed institute.;Sorry to hijack the topic. Can some one tell me, how do I learn R? YouTube videos are not helpful enough.;Certificates from companies and universities are of some value. But, the rest are not.

Udemy is the weakest in all MOOCs as any Tom, Dick, and Harry with a webcam can [start teaching courses on it](https://youtu.be/jnovz-qihrU). Not that there aren't good teachers constructing courses there.

There is another **caveat to MOOCs;** Any projects you do under them would likely be common for thousands of students world over, who've had the same classes or sessions. This is also known to other professionals and students alike who've either gone through the course or known about it - make sure as u/TWO-WHEELER-MAFIA said, you make another new project where you apply that knowledge on your own for your portfolio, demonstrating what you've actually gained from the course.

There are test-based certifications that help in early stages for certain professions like [Associate Android Developer Certification](https://developers.google.com/certification/associate-android-developer) which is a pricier online tested certification from Google or, the famous [Oracle Certified Java Professional Certification](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-8-programmer/trackp_357). These cost more than an ordinary MOOC course but, *worth a lot* in initial career as they give you leverage in haggling for better pay, etc.

Finally, there are a distance/online professional courses which are basically virtual degree courses which are as costly as online Masters or Professional courses in a brick and mortar university campus from universities like [Arizona Statue University](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-computer-science-asu) etc. [Link](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=Master%20of%20Computer%20Science&utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_content=Deg-11-DLP-ASU-MCS-US&campaignid=6495589164&adgroupid=78202422215&device=c&keyword=computer%20science%20degree&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=381807047440&hide_mobile_promo=&gclid=CjwKCAjwkPX0BRBKEiwA7THxiOThPzNFb4Y86S7PJdtImXuFpLkykPt5lK-4KIfg3KKI5tzBmk_EFxoCJxcQAvD_BwE)

To be honest with you, there are many diplomas in medical jurisprudence all across the law schools in India. 
However, don't do those. 

Those are designed for lawyers intending practice criminal law. Therefore, what you learn in those diplomas is rudimentary anatomy, forensics and medicine. 
Something that'll help lawyers cross examine doctors in criminal cases basically. 

Not doctors. Doctors already study that. In depth. 

There are no courses of medical jurisprudence for doctors that'll teach you laws. 

In fact, I was part of a committee to design such a course for govt Ayurvedic college. That one didn't happen eventually. 

If you want to gain knowledge of law, my advice really is, reading in general, and doing a diploma course around the lines of ""introduction to law"" .. 
Such diploma courses happen in most law colleges. 

That'll actually give you an in general idea of how to study law, books, case law search and certain basic principles of law. 
With that, you will be better equipped to read and understand the laws, along with learning how to research. 
That, is the best course scenario for the moment."

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.

Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 

After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.

Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.

After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us.

**Context:** More than 324 people have died in the worst flooding in nearly a century in the south Indian state of Kerala.

Roads are damaged, mobile phone networks are down, an international airport has been closed and more than 220,000 people have been left homeless after unusually heavy rain in the past nine days.

Officials repeatedly revised the death toll upwards from 86 people on Friday morning to more than 300 by the evening as a massive rescue operation reached more flood-hit regions. “Around 100 people died in the last 36 hours alone,” a state official said.

Casualty numbers are expected to increase further, with thousands more people still stranded and less intense though still heavy rain forecast for at least the next 24 hours. Many have died from being buried in hundreds of landslides set off by the flooding. ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/17/kerala-floods-death-toll-rescue-effort-india))

They should focus on subs accommodating and/or encouraging bigotry in the guise of free speech and/or dark humor. This harmless post, an attempt at raising awareness towards actual suffering of actual people should be fine. It ought to be anyway. </rant>

;I'll match your donation, OP

EDIT: Woke up to see this rapidly went out of my *aukaat*, so [here's my meager donation to the cause](https://imgur.com/a/CJykel3). I hope my brothers and sisters from Kerala can forgive me. 

As compensation, I'm going to spend the rest of today and tomorrow volunteering in the collection drives around Hyderabad. If anyone is in town, do come by and drop off anything you can spare. Packaged food, blankets, sanitary pads, and of course water bottles. They never have enough water during the floods. I remember how there were people charging 1000 rupees a bottle during the Uttarakhand floods. 

I will also be asking my friends to donate as much as they can. Cheers and I hope the storm blows over quickly. ;Was hoping to match OP's amount, but this is fast going out of my *aukaat*. So here's my contribution: https://i.imgur.com/R7E3btm.png

Proof - http://imgur.com/gallery/lBjMTnD;I see several people confused in some other threads on how rain can cause so much damage. I can understand your thoughts as most places do not see this much rain. So, I will explain.

During normal years, Kerala receives the largest rainfall among all major states in India. For comparison, the nearby Tamil Nadu gets 945mm rainfall annually, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Himachal pradesh, Andhra pradesh, MP, J&K, UP, Bihar etc gets some 900mm to 1200mm range rainfall. Haryana, Delhi, Punjab etc get 350mm to 700mm...

If compared with US, california gets 570mm, Iowa gets 850mm, Kentucky	gets 1200mm, Kanas gets 900mm and in general most of USA gets under 1000mm, with the highest being Hawaii at 1600mm. Average for UK is around 850mm. Average for France is 600mm,

Meanwhile the Indian state of Kerala gets about 3000mm average rainfall during ""normal years"". So, by default it is a very rainy place.

Now, what is Kerala(for non Indians). It can be considered as the most developed state of India, with Human development Index more comparable to Europe than to rest of Indian states. It has 100% literacy rates, reasonably good infrastructure and everything is far better than most places in India. Kerala is well known for its natural scenic beauty with [serene backwaters](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=kerala+tourism&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiMsKLRh_TcAhUSfX0KHe3SAHUQ_AUICigB&biw=1229&bih=638) and [cool hills](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=munnar&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu6rn2h_TcAhUGU30KHR22DrsQ_AUIDCgD&biw=1229&bih=638).

This time, there is non stop rain every few hours daily for like past three months, and that too very strongly.. it is record rain never seen before... most likely it will go in history as the highest rain ever in kerala. Some dam shutters which were NEVER opened in past 40 years had to be opened, and still it is overflowing.

What is the strongest rain you have ever seen? At my place, that strongest rain is continuously falling for past 95 hours straight non-stop... and even before that it was raining heavily every few hours. Even now, it is raining heavily outside. My well has twice more water now than ever seen in history of that well(past 60+years).

We are receiving some 300 to 800% more rain per day than **OUR** normal, throughout the entire state. [source](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/natural-disasters/kerala-received-316-more-rainfall-than-normal-on-august-8-imd-61362)... Think of the heaviest rain you have seen, now think of it with 5 times more intensity, now imagine that rain happening every few hours daily for past 90 days and now you get a picture of what is happening here. The last time a similar sized rain happened was in **1924**, and at that time the entire state had flooded with immense loss. It was so bad that there is a wikipedia entry about it - [Great flood of 99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_flood_of_99). This time, it could be more intense than that.

The shutters of 35 of the 39 humongous dams in Kerala, including the 123-year-old *Mullaperiyar Dam*, largest earthen dam in India - *Banasura Sagar Dam*, largest reservoir of Kerala - *Malampuzha dam,* highest arch dam of Asia - *Idukki dam* etc have been opened simultaneously for the first time in history. The remaining ones are about to be opened.

And, remember that we are talking about an entire state which is adjacent to the Arabian sea, so most places in Kerala are just barely above sea-level. In fact, the lowest altitude in entire India is in Kuttanad, Kerala and that is **-7.2feet**. That is negative altitude which means it is land which is below sea level.

In so many such places, water **CANNOT** go anywhere. Water which fall on the ground will not go inside earth, instead even if it is not raining, the water will come upwards from the ground even if you cover all sides with walls and drains.

The Kochi airport, which is the fourth busiest airport in India by international traffic, has been shut down till August 26 due to this problem. Its elevation is mere 5m from sea level, and water is not going down into earth, so the runway has been flooded!

Now, how do people die due to rain? Most of the deaths are due to landslides caused by the rain, or houses collapsing due to rain taking away the foundation of the house. Few people have have drowned and few have been electrocuted, but those cases are rare.

The death toll is around 175 as of now. This is not as high as some other disaster struck zones around the world because Kerala is a pretty well managed state, and is perhaps the best state in India to handle heavy rainfall and floods, as rain is usual for Kerala and so everything is designed around it with age-old drainage systems throughout the state. But, every system has a limit, and that limit has been far exceeded now.

The government also handled the situation very well with optimally opening dams and conducting the rescue operation and evacuation at the right time. However, the loss to the state is immense, with the current estimate going over 8000 crore.

So, when Kerala says rains are heavy, the rains are really really heavy, and we are talking about catastrophic levels.

Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Edit. Join /r/atheismindia for more discussion on leaving your faith and coming back to the real world.

Dear r/all please do take the time to know about the recent religious riots happening in the Capital city delhi /r/India",Fuck all Religion,0.7,"I don't think ""atheist"" or ""none"" is an option under the official column of religions in India. So if you are born in a Muslim family you'll forever be a Muslim, unless you convert to some other religion. There are officially no ""atheists"" in India. We need to change this and develop the atheist culture in India.;Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?
Then He is not omnipotent.

Is He able, but not willing?
Then He is malevolent.

Is He both able and willing?
Then whence cometh evil?

Is He neither able nor willing?
Then why call Him God?

#Pure Comedy
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*~Father John Misty*  

The comedy of man starts like this  
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips  
And so Nature, she divines this alternative  
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever  greets us on the other end  
Is kind enough to fill us in  
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever   since  

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to   address  
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron     deficient  
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look    after the kids    
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this   thing its milk?  
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we   can switch  
It's hard not to fall in love with something so   helpless  
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this  

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy  
Just waiting until the part where they start to   believe  
They're at the center of everything  
And some all powerful being endowed this horror   show with meaning  

Oh, their religions are the best  
They worship themselves yet they're totally   obsessed  
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks,   these unbelievable outfits  
And they get terribly upset  
When you question their sacred texts  
Written by woman-hating epileptics  
 
Their languages just serve to confuse them  
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure  
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring  
And hand out prizes when someone patents the   cure  
Where did they find these goons they elected to   rule them?  
What makes these clowns they idolise so   remarkable?  
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new   gods   
So they can go on being godless animals  

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but   to believe  
Their horizons that just forever recede  
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a   prison of beliefs  
That they never ever have to leave  

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman   would conceive!  
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive   is the struggle to survive  
But the only thing that they request is something   to numb the pain with  
Until there's nothing human left  
Just random matter suspended in the dark  
I hate to say it, but each other's all we got;Religion is the main cause of unrest in India.;Religion is one intense fandom.;Religion is legalised madness

Edit: Thank you for the shining silver kind stranger.;[deleted];To all those parents and students who called Moral Science classes a sham, this is why we needed it.;Religion is an expired product that has continued to stay. It should have been eradicated or died a while back but has not. If we as species have to reach next level then we need to get over religion.;Any existing religion is like Superman, did wonders on paper but doesn't actually exists.;“When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”

― Jiddu Krishnamurti


Questioner :  Kindly give a straight reply. Does god exist, or not? Yes, or no? If yes, how best to realize him in this life?

JK : ""If you examine very closely, you have created god. Right? In India there are about – I was told there are about 300,000 gods and more. (Laughs) You understand? Every local person has his own god.

So, sirs, we have created god. See the irony of it. Thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created. Which is, to worship oneself and call it god. You understand all this? – the better part of you is god. Right? I wonder if you understand this. First of all, let’s be clear. Have you created god? The local gods round the corner, or the local god in Rome, or in Tirupati, or wherever, you have created them, haven’t you? You are so very uncertain, aren’t you, so frightened. If you say we have created, then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that. Out of your fear you want security. Right? You want safety, you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid. You follow? So you create that, and then worship that. Just see what you are doing! Going to Tirupati and putting all your money in the bag – do you think gods want your money? Sir, look at it all. You have nothing to offer but money, garlands, prostrations, rituals. Right? You have nothing else to offer. Have you realised the tragedy of this, sirs?

If you love – not god, that’s very easy to love god because it is an abstraction, it has not much meaning. But if you love, that very love is god, that very love is sacred. You won’t go outside to look for god. You understand all this, sirs!

And the questioner wants to know if I believe in god. I don’t. Because god is something created by man. There is such a thing as eternity, which is to be outside of time. Right, sir? For that you must have a mind, a heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life. Right? From your vanity, your arrogance, your selfishness – you follow, sir? And we say, we are not capable of it, tell us what to do. You are back in the cycle, somebody to tell you what to do. Sir, you are in a jungle, you have to walk through it by yourself. Right? And for that you need vitality and vigour and strength. Not belief in god, in goodness – belief has no place where truth is concerned.

Let's turn all religions into mythology again.;religion was invented by smart rulers to control dumb people, and its something that's sadly never going to change. when you teach a child something, the older they get the harder it is for you to change their mind, and when they have kids of their own they teach them the same thing and it becomes an amplification loop. we live in a world where people take incredible luxuries for granted because thats what we're born with. the modern world allows dumb people to be loud and grab the attention of other dumb people who think the same, something that was never possible before. for god's sake just look at all the anti science movements, you can calculate the speed of light using a microwave and a chocolate bar but if they don't believe it it doesn't exist. people who think this way dont want to know the truth, they want what they think is the truth to be the truth and when that line of thinking combines with conflicting opinions all hell breaks loose.;*sorts by controversial,* *grabs popcorn*;Careful not to cut yourself on all that edge.;Disclaimer first: I am 100% an atheist.

Having said that, the problem isn't religion in and of itself.

Most religious teachings usually boil down to 'care about others' and 'be a decent person'. Yes, there's a lot of fucked up stuff in the texts as well, not denying that. But a lot of people find comfort and strength in their beliefs, and you saying they should just let go of it because it's illogical and dumb, is frankly as intolerant as religious fanatics. Religion also does not have to be at odds with science and learning. I remember asking a religion teacher in school which is correct: The Big Bang or God made the world. She told me 'Both. The Big Bang happened, but God made it happen (obvs not something I believe, but not the point is) She also reiterated that the Bible is not literal. And she was a nun. And, as you may have heard, Einstein believed in God too. So, again, it's possible for both religion and scientific knowledge to coexist.

Organised religion is absolutely a problem. In my transition from Roman Catholic to atheist, I had a 'I believe in God, but not in the Church' phase. Religious organisations can be corrupt to the core. People twisting scriptures and teachings to suit their own agendas of hate and power are a problem. People using religion to support ignorance and prejudice that harms others (like being against the LGBTQ community, or anti vaxxers, or sects who believe medical intervention should not be allowed) are a problem. But religious people who use religion to find personal comfort, help others, and be part of a community? There is nothing wrong with that.

Yes, I still believe the world would be better off without religion, because of all of the people who exploit it and do so much harm in its name. But it is not my, or your, or anyone's place to dictate to someone what they should or should not believe in if they are not harming you in any way and just living their life peacefully. Because, again, if you do this, it makes you no better than religious nuts who want to dictate how we live our lives.;Amen"

Intriguing.;Lot of posters here don't seem to have a clue about recent and older Indian construction techniques. 

The Shivaji stairs were hand carved out of stone using chisel and hammer. It probably took one mason 4-5 days to hew one stone. The same can be easily done today, by hand, but most people would not want to pay that kind of money. You could get the stone cut by machine. You wouldn't need much cement or lime once the stone is squared and cut-just the joints between.

You can produce the same lime as was used in the construction of Ancient Delhi, or the many forts, quite easily. But it takes a lot of labor and effort.

The 2013 stairs took about a day to build and the main reason for the cement flaking off is probably the cement to sand ratio was off. Typical correct ratio would be 5:1 or 6:1 sand to cement. The contractor may have stolen cement and may have used 8:1. And people walking on it before it was set.

Edit 1-Also the cement may not have been kept cool and hydrated with water during curing. ;[Survivor Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qd3erAPI9w);This is absolute truth.

I kid you not, I have been to enormous amount of historical structures around India. That is what I used to do during studies and beyond. Almost all of them have a durability that will put any modern Indian construction to shame. Not just stairs, but anything from buttresses, roofs, fences (yes, stone ones) and the strength of walls themselves. And I am not even talking about forts (who would be intentionally be made of large blocks of fired clay and stone), but the usual buildings.

Heck, Fatehpur Sikri has a better fountain than what our governments build in gardens, if they do so at all.

It is a crying shame our government is not even able to build up to the standards of North Korea. PWD and ilk are the laziest and most incompetent organizations ever. Can't even hire trained quasi-literate labourers or learn to build a fucking staircase.

The tragedy is, India has some of the most beautiful historical architecture on earth...compare this to how we build things now.;""Corruption"" - Upper steps at Raigad fourth built by Chhatrapati Shivaji in 1656; lower steps by Maharashtra govt in 2013

This is true for many things. i.e. if you know king of gondal built pools and roads which are in today's day and age still remains intact and municipality built roads are gone in 2 years. And they look good too :(;It's not corruption as much as cluelessness. The edges of steps should be either rounded like [this](http://c8.alamy.com/comp/ARY3BR/bright-and-colourful-subway-underpass-steps-with-tiled-pattern-design-ARY3BR.jpg) or metal coated like [this](http://www.elitetiling.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Fiveways-Corner-Subway-Southbound-Steps.jpg). I've observed skywalks steps in Bangalore are metal coated and they have been very sturdy and durable. ;It does make one good point, I think.

Modern day politicians have a horizon of expectations for their policies to produce results that lasts for the duration of their term in office, at maximum.
They want their electorate to see marked improvement in quality of life within 5 years of election, so they can be associated with the achievements.

The problem is this system does not incentivize a perspective on development that extends into the long-term. Investments are not made that sacrifice a little bit now to receive more for future generations.

That's not to say every staircase should be built to last millenia or longer. We are working with finite resources and every investment has an opportunity cost. Stonework is expensive. Sometimes it might be better to put a little less into A when investing the difference into B gives you more bang for your buck.

Before sharing things like this to create a sensation, one should take a close look at what one is sharing. 

Considering the picture is authentic, we must note that the one made in the times of Shivaji was made of blocks of **stone**, whereas the ones made in our time is made of **some sort of tile, a mere replica of stone**. In our time, we have learned the way to copy a design, mimic nature in it and make it better or more beautiful, but when it comes to copying the strength, we are far behind nature. This is true to everything in our life. We are more for image and less concerned about identity. About which Guy Debord wrote: 

***""Images detached from every aspect of life merge into a common stream, and the former unity of life is lost forever. Apprehended in a partial way, reality unfolds in a new generality as a pseudo­world apart, solely as an object of contemplation. The tendency toward the specialization of images­ of ­the world finds its highest expression in the world of the autonomous image, where deceit deceives itself. The spectacle in its generality is a concrete inversion of life, and, as such, the autonomous movement of non­life. ""***

This is the trash we are shown on TVs

Source: ABP News;As an Indian living in the UK, it's so frustrating trying to figure out the truth of what actually took place. On India's side it's 'We killed 300 terrorists' while on Pakistan's side it's just memes about them missing and hitting trees.

Now India is claiming technical faults crashed a plane, and that India downed an F-16, while Pakistan claims they shot down 2 jets and captured 1 pilot.

Fucking sad seeing chest-thumping going on on both sides, and any questioning of the official narrative on both sides leads to accusations of treason. I just want to know what the fuck happened.;'Imran Khan Addresses Pakistani and Indian People' Summary:

&#x200B;

1. Wars are fought on miscalculations. No one thought WWI, WWII, War on Terror, Vietnam War, etc. would escalate over the years. Can India and Pakistan afford a miscalculation? 
2. Terrorism is not in the interest of Pakistan (on our own land or on others land); we are focusing on economy.
3. Pulwama was a tragedy for the Indian people.  I asked for evidence and joint investigation between Pakistan and India. We are willing to help you in anyway. You don't have the right to be judge, jury and executioner on our land.
4. You challenged our sovereignty and violated LoC. We did the same. We wanted to show that we are also capable if you want to escalate things.
5. There was some conflict in the air; Indian people lost two aircrafts. Their pilots are with us.
6. Lets talk about our issues and focus on peace, not war.;Things are escalating. I hope we don't go at war. Nothing good comes out of wars.

Edit: Seeing the released video of our captured pilot is so gut wrenching. I don't know what to feel.

Edit 2: At this point, with so much of false information being released, I'm beginning to question the evidence of every news report. Confused.

Edit 3: Lost one MiG 21, Pilot MIA confirmed during conference. 

Edit 4: 1 PAK AF Jet shot down confirmed during conference

Edit 5: 2 terrorists killed, confirmed or not? It was mentioned in the conference. ;I can confirm that the captured pilot in the twitter video is indeed an Indian flying pilot. He is my classmates husband Abhinandan. I have attended their wedding and i do remember him very clearly.;Please don't be war.

Edit 2: [Here's BBC website with live updates](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-asia-47383889)


Edit 3: From the article in Edit 2,


> Maj Gen Ghafoor also said Pakistan could have inflicted damage, ""but we don't want to go on the path of war"".


Also, Pakistan is claiming that no F-16 fighter jets was shot down and none was used in this operation ;I really hope that if there is an arrest of Indian pilot, we own it. I don't want to be the country that can't respect their soldiers' martyrdom to win a propaganda war. ;This will be full on propaganda from both sides now on and I won’t believe either unless I see a downed enemy aircraft, a captured/dead pilot/ a video of an aircraft being shot down. This goes for both indian and pakistani claims.;I feel sad, really sad for the pilot MIA. Even in the video, he knows he can be tortured and roughed and face the fate of Sarabjeet or Kulbhushan but still he puts a brave face to say 'I can't tell you that' and adds a Sir salutation. That's just heartbreaking for me.

I really hope Imran offers to return him as a show of good faith and we can give peace a chance before this escalates.;I wish FB and Twitter didn't exist. 18 years ago the situation wouldn't be this bad and I know that because 18 years ago we shot down a PAF airplane and everything was solved diplomatically. There was no stupid idiots asking for a war.;I don't think this act will result in war but it sure is fueling the flames and will act as a catalyst.


Going to war is a humongous decision so we have to wait and see how all of this will play. 

But it sure looks like that Pakistan is pushing their luck.;One thing is certain - there's no shortage of social media warriors on both sides.;An old video of the pilot 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZitItZ8lFk;Just reading this thread has been crazy, from no IAF pilots aren't allowed mustaches to ok that's one of ours;Fuck all the media channels. Literally fuck them. No facts just constant warmongering, all in the name of TRP/agenda.;The Pakistani military now has Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman under custody. He is a MiG 21 pilot. This is confirmed.;I'm in a Liberal Pakistani group on fb and most of the people there are saying the pilot should be treated with respect and handed over quick. Just shows that not all Pakistanis are terrorists or want war. ;A lot of people here seem to be of the opinion that the capture of our brave soldier(s) was Pakistan getting ""lucky"". Though that might be the case, I don't think it is. And it might be disrespectful to consider it so. 

I wrote this as a response to another comment here, and I thought I'll just share it again:

> I know people keep using the words ""lucky"" whenever the enemy does well. 

> I am an Indian. And I absolutely believe that our country is better than theirs in many fields and points of comparison. Our army is better and stronger than theirs. And our airforce is as well, of course. I am not sure of our political class -- but I would suspect, as a whole, even that is better than its Pakistani counterpart. (Unnecessary joke) perhaps one of the places where they are better than us is Coke Studio. 

> But back to the topic at hand: 

> We released no proof of the damage we did with our strike yesterday, and I am beginning to think that we didn't achieve much (other than, of course, show that we are capable and willing of cross border airforce-led skirmishes). The 300 to 600 terrorists being killed is most certainly an exaggeration. Propaganda as well. Of course, the Government didn't give that figure. But many Indians believe it. 
The Pakistanis believe we hit some trees. The truth, as it is in most cases, might rest between the claims for both sides. 

> Today, when they countered (which they said they would), they claim they intentionally hit no target but were there to show that they can. We claim that we foiled their attempts to hit their real target. (Here, I'm not too sure what to believe.)

> However, in the pursuit that followed thereafter, it looks like a well-tested and age-old Milliatry tactic was used by them -- famously used by the Mongols very often. 

> Their jets retreated. Ours went in after them (crossing the LOC again). And this time, they were ready with their defences. A trap was laid, and we fell for it. They egged us to follow them back, and in our pursuit, shot us down. 

> Of course, they knew we would be on high alert. And we would scramble our jets. 

> This doesn't feel like ""luck"". It feels calculated. 

> Undermining and underestimating them does us no good. In a way, it disrespects our own military -- our defense forces aren't fighting a mentally challenged enemy. The threat is real and capable. 

> Both are militaries aren't the best (though I know ours is stronger). But both are war hardened. Both are capable. 

> I just hope we de-escalate immediately. This war will destroy us both. ;If they return the pilot in goodwill resulting in de-escalation the whole incident could be a blessing in disguise.;Ok someone please STFU the media.

But the question is will modi step back? He may be fearing to do so because he does not want to be labeled as coward.

I don't even know where to go and which website, news officials to trust. ;Can our media for once act like a fucking responsible grownup? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And God forbid if either of us uses Nukes, god! Most people really dont know how bad Nukes are. The ones on twitter act like they should be the ones calling the shots. 

&#x200B;

Also, will media preaching help? It might calm the public which in turn will reduce the pressure on the government. ;Can anyone tell me how reliable the info from flightradar24 is? In the last 30mins, I saw 2 Indian military planes take off, one fly along the Pakistani border and the other fly directly towards the border. I deadass watched the second plane’s flight entry change to an international flight with no callsign, then both planes disappeared off the radar. Used the replay feature on the website to confirm.

Paranoid/10.

Edit: According to another redditor Planes were Indian Air Force, second plane changed to a Ukrainian 747 before both disappeared.

Not saying they were shot down, just they aren’t appearing on the map anymore.

I’ll verify in a bit.

Edit2: Planes were IAF Antonov An-32RE from Adampur and Ilyushin Il-76MD from unknown location. Upon further review, the second plane disappears from radar while an international flight with no callsign seems to be flying in a parallel flight plan in close proximity. The *new* second plane icon continues on course for a while until the icon flys around erratically all over map and disappears, so it’s hard to determine if the aircraft was there to begin with. Was confusing watching it live. I saw a C17 Globemaster in there somewhere.;For anyone worried about a Nuclear war-its not gonna happen.

India has a no first use policy i.e we won't launch our nukes first in an offensive against another country. Our nukes are primarily there for MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) i.e if you nuke us we will destroy you.

Meanwhile, Pakistan definitely doesn't want to get wiped off the face of the earth. The primary reason they developed nukes was so that there wouldn't be another situation like 1971, where we overpowered them in conventional war and they lost half of their country i.e they won't use nukes unless they are under risk of occupation-which I don't think India wants to do.

The only scenario I'm worried about is terrorists using nukes. Hopefully Pakistan, Isi or the army or whoever is in control is sensible enough to not hand a nuke to a terrorist organisation. ;One thing is sure - Our media is SHIT! Absolute garbage;I have to say, yesterday the Pakistani government and military were looking like utterly incompetent fools while India was looking organised and professional. Now the situation is totally reversed.

Multiple aircrafts crashing, not sure if its from Pakistani firing or technical problems, lack of communication from the government and no statement from the leader of our country. Meanwhile the media is doing god know what, reporting bullshit and inventing stuff out of thin air. Everything looks to be disorganized and in disarray.

This is 1/3rd the Government's fault and 2/3rds the media fault. The government should have gotten ahead of all the rumours and put rest to any speculation. They should reassure the citizens and tell them what has happened.

Meanwhile, the media needs to shut the fuck up about things that they don't know about. This is what happens when your primary concern is being nationalistic instead of being objective. Like the government never even quoted a figure saying how many terrorists were killed and the news channels in an effort to outdo other channels and be the first, starts saying a bullshit figure of 300. Even in victory they're making us look like fools. ;P L E A S E    D E - E S C A L A T E!

The only people who want war are the ones who haven't experienced it first hand.;One thing this has shown is that both India and Pakistan have huge issues with sensationalized media. It seems like this is a very dangerous time to be doing that.;If they did capture the pilot as it appears to be, then India will have no option but to either capitulate, or to escalate. 

Can't capitulate because the public will chew Modi alive. If they escalate then we're fucked

Updating as he's speaking

1. Consider this as a curfew - Modi
2. This will be a 3-week lockdown...
3. As per experts -If we are not able to control it in 3 weeks, we will have to pay a huge price for this.
4. 1 infected guy can infect hundreds in less than a week as per the experts and initially, you won't be able to detect any symptoms.
5. Italy and America have world-class facilities still they were not able to stop it from spreading.
6. From their experience we can learn that there is only one way to cope with this Virus, We have to stay at home ""no matter what happens"", Practice Social Distancing.
7. Don't cross that Laxman-Rekha, break the chain.
8. Our current actions will decide the fate of our country.
9. ""Jaan hai toh Jahan hai""
10. If we won't behave in these 21 days of lockdown, it could result into a setback of 21 years.
11. Pray and appreciate the efforts of those Ambulance drivers, nurses, doctors who are working for us and sanitizing our localities.
12. Appreciate the efforts of the security forces who are away from their families and they have to deal with our rude behavior sometimes.
13. WHO, Medical experts are guiding us and the Central Government is taking appropriate steps to cope with this issue.
14. INR 15,000 Crore allocated to improve our medical infrastructure.
15. Medical and Paramedical training will be provided.
16. Healthcare will be the first priority of every state from now on.
17. Please don't pay attention to fake news.
18. PLEASE Don't take any medicines before you consult any doctor at any cost, it could be fatal.
19. Take care of your family, The only way we can get through this is by maintaining this lockdown
20. Please follow all the rules and guidelines given out by WHO and Central Government.

\--End of Speech-- (Now correcting if I put anything wrong here, although I'm sure I didn't miss anything)

Tl:DR

1. Social distancing is the only way to fight this.
2. 21 days will decide our fate.
3. Whole country under Lockdown (consider it a curfew only) until 14th April (21 days)
4. ALL ESSENTIAL SERVICES WILL REMAIN FUNCTIONAL.;[deleted];Actually appreciate what the government is doing.

Edit 2: Had a call with one of the dealers, he says the shop (selling the required medicines, situated in Sector 11 Chandigarh) will be open by 0900 tomorrow. God bless this country especially the poor.

Yeah boys, we got the medicine today, though one of the salt iv solution were not available (from one brand).

Yesterday, one of the redditor in the oncology field advised to use the same medicine from a different brand.

Our doctor confirmed this too.

So we bought that medicine drug and everything went smooth from there on.

No theatrics. On point. Laid bare the threat, and announced strict but necessary measures.;DD News Live Link, rewind a bit to see PM Modi's Speech with English Subs

https://youtu.be/EaOsJRru-YQ;#Jaan hai toh jahaan hai;Why didn't he say anything about groceries and medicines? That is literally the first thing I am worried about.

Edit : I saw PMs tweet. Wish he had said it in his speech. I am also skeptical as to how this is going to work. And  am hopeful it won’t be like demonetisation where there was no planning for implementation. Fingers crossed!;Nice. He's saying don't listen to rumors and fake news. Only take meds that are approved by doctors. Hope these cow dung aficionados are listening to this.;[deleted];Shouldn't we declare national emergency, so people can relax on bank emi's, rent, electricity bills etc.;What does this mean? We can't go out for even essential services?;Man, it feels good to be finally agreeing with our Prime Minister on something.;I am not understanding what lockdown means, will we be able to buy Groceries and things like that because our current stock will last just 4 more days I think. If yes, then anyone could possibly walk around and say they are out to buy groceries.

Will there be any sort of punishment for those caught roaming freely? If yes, then on what basis ?;Essential supplies are going to be available. [Please do not panic. Please.](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1242476408896507910?s=19);Hope people don't draw a line with lakshman rekha (pesticide) on their doors to keep the virus at bay from tomorrow. Who know we may see some WhatsApp message like the rohini nakshatra one.;Good luck Indian friends, respect from Chile;[deleted];One thing I find disconcerting is the lack of transparency and finer details regarding a lot of things. There are no clear guidelines on how and when the people in isolation or quarantine are going to be tested/treated or discharged.

Then regarding the essential supplies. It's not clear what all is available and can be bought and from where. And what about the supplies from the government to the people who need it the most.

Hope there would be clarity regarding these things in the coming times.;Dont panic and purchase a lot guys kirana shop and pharmacy and milk shop are always open;My family has a seasonal business. This is gonna fuck shit up this year for us. Happened with GST and we were finally recovering this year. Fml.;https://imgur.com/a/K23PvpJ

Detailed order.


P.s. It's a great read tbh.;My Grandfather is bedridden and is on life support i need protein powder which won't available till tomorrow he can't eat on his own he will starve my god i am so scared they were run out in all the shops...

Also all veggies are sold on gaadi..so no veggies? i am confused and 3 week complete lockdown? food runs out what then? what happens if some building water supply breaks..?

Also people don't really care about social distancing no one is following it fuck this could be it.;I'm all up for this, but what do I do about pet supplies? I need cat litter for my cats.

Edit: What's with thr downvotes, I'm genuinely asking. What if someone's pet needs food and stuff? This is a tricky situation.;My dad is stuck in his posting. He can't come back home. He is alone and will have to manage everything himself now. Cooking and stuff. Hope he stays alright;Lockdown has been initiated. It's a thing we really needed and I'm glad that this shit will finally be taken seriously by people. I just hoped he would have been clear about the essential supplies as people are swarming to stores right now. They are scared, and I empathize with them because people get afraid. PM should have emphasized that people should not go out now. Now, because of the crowding, there will so many more people who will get infected. I expect cases to rise even more now, because of this.

Another thing that should be done ASAP is **educating the goddamn cops with what are essential goods and not to just laathi charge people going to buy vegetables or medicines.** Sure, beat the shit of people loitering or taking selfies of empty roads but for fucks sake, stop harassing people who are out buying essentials. An acquaintance of mine was not only hit by cops but was given a lecture as to why he didn't stock up on vegetables earlier. Do these dense idiots not realize vegetables don't last very long?

Also, please don't forget your pets. Buy food for them when you're picking up supplies for yourself.

I hope we get through this. Best of luck everyone.;Goodbye guys. It was nice knowing you all.;Finally!!! Now that this has started, I want to ask how can we help the poorest of the people in the country. People who earn 100-200 rupees per day and will go hungry or be under huge amount of debt if they can't work for a few days. Are there any NGOs we can donate to that can help such people with food and essentials during these times. 

Lock down will have to continue past April 15 for the virus to be completely contained but a very good start. Let's take it one step at a time. If people cooperate and the state provides the hospitals with enough medical supplies, we can come out of this pretty come summer. Fingers crossed.;I wish he had emphasised in his speech that essential services would remain open. People went beserk and started rushing out and hoarding food to prepare for the lockdown which was unnecessary; Yesterday, I commented on this thread that I am having to go to the hospital during this lockdown on weekdays. My friend (from Nodia, WB) is presently living with us (Kolkata, WB) for her Stage 3 cancer treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital, New Town, Kolkata. Her radiation will be going on for 28 days, Monday to Friday.

We have hired a car. We carry papers and ID (including patient ID) and even have a signboard on the car saying that it's going to the hospital. Today, while we were inside the hospital, our driver was beaten up by the cops at the parking lot, just in the same way you guys are seeing in the videos that are being shared online. He stated the reason why he was there. The cops did not contact us or anything, he was simply beaten up.

This is anarchy.

I am not on social media other than Reddit and I do not intend to be because of how unreasonable people are in general. However, I would like to inform you all that certain cops are beating up people, whether they have a reason to or not. They are not communicating at all. We are trying our best to find out which police personnel exactly did this and take the relevant legal steps after the lockdown is lifted. I do not think that the police have orders to beat up anyone they wish to.

I would also like you all to warn others. And if you or any person you know is presently deployed to police the roads during the lockdown, kindly let us know what rules/instructions you have. Because today, it seemed like you have none.;Nagma from ndtv just said that their studio is already getting pictures of people gathering in numbers and panic buying groceries. Shit is fucked up.;Does this mean people will scramble to shops between now at midnight?

If doing it for hoarding, these four hours might do more damage.;Let's hope this doesn't gets extended beyond 21 days;[deleted];* There is a huge population of India which is dependent on day to day daily wages to survive . A 21 day lockdown pretty much screws them over badly . Now ,  I know many state governments have announced relief measures and central government is going to continue MGNREGA , but we all know the track record of the governments with their welfare schemes , especially in such a short time period .


* There is also a significant population of India who have been at the receiving end of this government's discriminatory policies . Many of them have 0 trust in the government ( I am not making a moral judgement ,I am just stating a fact ) . 



* The government's track record with previous such moves hasn't been really good . Demonetization was a train wreck . Article 370 was similarly a train wreck . GST was a disaster despite years of preparation  . Now we are supposed to believe that the various government will effectively pull off all necessary arrangements for this lockdown in a matter of few days ?


* 21 days of lockdown won't defeat coronavirus . It will return with a vengeance . The only way of dealing with it is mass societal awareness and changing our behaviour permanently . This 21 days lockdown will be useless if it creates a false sense of security and people just go back to their old habits;Petrol pumps in Pune have been closed for private vehicles since yesterday, even though they are covered under essential services during this lockdown. If groceries, milk and medicines are not available nearby, how is one supposed to travel? What if there is a health emergency and need for visiting hospitals? Other alternate modes of transport are already banned or stopped..and now we cannot even use our own vehicles?! This is fked up..and starting to feel as if the ‘cure’ is worse than the problem.This also gives an example of how local authorities (Collector, in this case) can override orders from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.;Much needed decision.
We need to break that process!!!"
sinsandtonic,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001DD18F898C8>,fyyx8c,Politics,9900,,The wealth inequality in India is truly horrifying,0.94,"Source?;Damn! These south Indians always get the good things! /s;This inequality will happen when we have a free market economy, but no social democracy. Like in the USA, and now India, which emulates them. 

Unless a country offers free world class education and healthcare, this gap will only increase. Most European countries that offer these don’t have such a yawning gap between the rich and poor. Tax money is used to give free education and healthcare of a very high degree of quality. 

When free quality education is lacking, opportunities to the poor are denied because the rich will send their children to the good schools, and will obviously have a head start over their poor counterparts for quality jobs. And the rich-poor gap will only increase. But if the poor were to receive the same (and free) quality education, they will be able to compete on a equal footing, and this gap will slowly reduce. 

Healthcare is a major financial burden when people get seriously ill. The rich have access to the best healthcare, and they can afford it. The not-so-well off will see a major chunk of their savings shaved off if they fall seriously ill. Only a free quality healthcare system will allow them to not worry about this expense head. But as things stand today, here too we are copying the USA system of healthcare (one of the worst in the western world), where the insurance companies make all the money, and yet this is denied to the poor. 

Our tax money needs to go into these two heads if the country’s rich-poor divide is to reduce. Else the situation will get progressively worse, something that we are currently witnessing. 

But our political class does not have such a vision. So it’s all a pipe dream.;The even bigger concern when we see only 3~4% of Indians pay taxes. Even though I assume the bottom 50% are tax exempted as their income is very less. The rest 50% should not be tax exempted. Government has always sided with the rich: the reason is two-folded - One, this way the top 10% support the government which in turn causes a huge influence base and Second, once the top 10% support, they are willing to shell some money to the parties as well which is also beneficial for them. Solution would be track every transaction so that black money and bribery can be removed. That way, wealth can be accurately measured. But however, there is doubt if any ruling party would take such a step as this would hugely affect their popularity and funds.;[deleted];The more I look at the infographic, more puzzling it becomes.

But not our assistance, because our government is about as useful as a paper towel in a tsunami.;I earn , let’s say a very good income by Indian standards and try not to pay any taxes. Please hold on the pitchforks . I don’t believe that any government will do anything good with my money. There is no trust . 
What I do instead is , funnel that money into A small school that runs for tribal children and provide them quality education. My method maybe imperfect , maybe I can’t scale beyond 10 kids and maybe I end up spending more than I would have paying my IT . But I am content that my rupees are bringing  real change to the community I live in.  I am too sick and tired to see a government that actually works and have given up entirely . Let’s change what I can.;20 lakh +pa is 1%.

Most people from North India work on their own I mean they mostly do business. I saw most of the people like this only.

We don't have that kinda business or business men here in Southern part. How are you so sure about this?;I'm a die hard capitalist. I always see it as 'be more productive and get more' trade.

We can use some Communism. /s;This make me mad;Inequality is not the issue. India can solve the problem by compulsory and accessible education and secondly by massive infrastructure  projects. The issue india faces is that many people still believe in the caste system and high population density. That makes any sort of progress hard. Regardless, India has done massively already to reduce poverty and improve the lives of of citizens.;Screams in Bernie Sanders;Ahh the American model. I see.;So we need 9% to join 50% to take on 41%.

The country still uses the caste system. There are groups of people called untouchables.;I know it looks bad. But this is how every economy looks like. This is not a problem specific to India.

Edit: I think I shouldn't have used the word ""every"". The correct word here is ""most"".;Get rid of the Caste system.;Why is everyone mad about other people being rich these days? What's your solution? Communism?;Seize the means of production my friends. India is an immensely wealthy country (6th largest economy in the world), and yet all the gains go to those stinking Ambanis. Why do you think that is? The reason is neoliberalism and the rent-seeking nature of private property that subjugates the rest of us into wage slavery. As we approach a world of post-scarcity in areas of automation, labour, energy, food and healthcare, will we share the benefits our technological development with everyone, or only see those benefits and wealth go to the rich. The choice is up to us, not them, because 99% >>> 1%.

Read the book ""fully automated luxury communism"" by this British journalist called Aaron Bastani. He outlines how solving climate change and income inequality isn't just contingent on technological development, but needs to be part of a greater political project that exposes the contradictions of the capitalist mode of production and the exploitation and artificial scarcity it'll impose on the rest of us even as we move to a world where we can realistically end poverty, hunger, disease and ageing.;Government and media lectures us to stop hoarding groceries which is means to stay alive while these mofos are hoarding wealth whole  year, every year.;https://youtu.be/qBCxIiC5ia4;Damn Kerala;I cannot understand  it, can someone please  explain.;>so hungry for nothing

There is no correct manner that a country should be governed. MP and MLA must first take a look at their own constituency. We vote for the betterment of that. But is there any way you can actually tell your MP or MLA what you need. Once elected do they even come back before the elections?

There is no system to accuse those who misuse their power. No system who should do what. No system how a country should work. If someone says something controversial in the Parliament they just remove it from the discussion. Dude this is not your personal diary. They should be held accountable for what they said.

This system is so shit that defense forces are attacking whom they should be defending and trust me they don't want to. But their salary comes from the government.

To me watching a movie is akin to admiring a beautiful painting. I don't want to be distracted. But I understand how the world works. So I don't mind the ads, although excess ads do get to me but, it's when they start putting augmented warnings over the movie it sorta spoils the essence of a scene. 

This is why I contain myself for three months and wait for Blu-ray to watch at the comfort of my home. It's a sacrifice but one that I don't mind.;I think 30 mins ads before a movie is common.
India theatres sold ad time for interval.
Joker doesn’t need an interval tbh.;May and a discomfort for you, but subtitles certainly help majority of people.

So he asked Muharram processions to be taken out the next day so that his Hindu subjects could celebrate Holi. That used to be the religious harmony and tolerance back in those days.;American here.

UnileverCancerFactor,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001DD196B6248>,38heyu,[R]eddiquette,8054,"I don't want to leave this be, and need some help on which NGO's might be interested in fighting this case.

**Background Reading**

* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)

The summary of these articles would be as follows,

A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.

HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.

A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.

I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.

I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.

Further studies in case you are interested.

[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). 

[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).

>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 µg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 µg/kg and 8.3 µg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.

>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.

This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 

Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.

edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.

To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.

edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.

I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.

Thank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a ""troll post"" as a few have alleged via PM.","Help, ideas needed.

;Do you have a test report of water sample testing for high mercury? If not, please collect some samples and get it tested. You can get some NGO to sponsor that if you cannot afford it.

Please compile some research papers/studies on the correlation between high mercury content and cancer.

Prepare one dossier with sample testing report and your research. Send it to government. Recruit NGOs to fight your cause based on these solid facts. Publish it on a blog post, link it from reddit and twitter etc. My 2 paise.;Mercury is a dangeorus poison which can have serious harmful effects, but it is not confirmed as possible cause of cancer. 

As per EPA mercury is not known to cause cancer, but we don't know that for sure. 

http://www.epa.gov/mercury/effects.htm ;- Mercury doesn't really cause cancer.
- Cancer isn't a single disease. What cancers are we talking about specifically?
- Problem might not be the mercury at all, but some other pollutant.
- 250 Cancer deaths isn't necessarily a lot. What's the age of the population? On average, every fifth person (about 20%) will get some form of cancer (in western Europe). In India the number is probably a lot lower due to infant mortality and high mortality rates due to treatable conditions (infectious diseases / trauma), so a high cancer morbidity/mortality in your village could, for example, correlate with a high average age and paradoxically a particularly safe area to live...

2. Additionally, also send this to Vox Media, BBC, NYT & The Guardian. These people are more serious than the Indian media which can be bought off by big Corporate money (not joking!) 

The Guardian is the most serious of all. They are known for their investigative journalism. 

Good luck!!;A little more details and this story can be transferred to a webpage/blog-post. This would then allow everyone to link back to that webpage.

Both are working on arsenic testing and filtering in Bangladesh, a lot of the tech should be applicable to other heavy metals.;It is about time we show this companies that India will not tolerate this kind of negligible behaviour towards health of the anyone. This needs to be on Front Page.

PS: why don't you name your village? this will help get it into the media quick.;All you media lurkers here please pick this up. 

Try making a blog post and possibly a video that can go viral.. This needs a lot of visibility.

edit: it appears that there is a legal case going on against HUL in the high court , with some high profile lawyers fighting against HUL , so thats that

;Punjab and pesticides - same story.;Contact media, keep sending pings by people over there to them till you hear back, it only works if they think it's catastrophic or popular. ;I highly doubt it is Mercury that is contributing to these higher rates of cancer. In isolated population enclaves, such as your village, it is not uncommon for cancer mortality rates to spike to 5,10, even 15% in some periods. This is simply due to genetic predisposition to cancer. Don't know how closely they look at genetic markers in India, but it maybe useful to look at the genetic background of all those people that have been dying of cancer to see if there is a commonality, which is what my guess would be. ;This wont lead to any action unless picked up by Western media. We need to get this seen by someone in NYT or HP. Unilever would hate Western media questioning them. From my side, I will try and connect you to my personal media connects. ;The only people fighting the good fight in cases like these are the people affected or concerned citizena like OP, who dont have a loud enough voice, or NGOs who are hated on this sub. We have to give this the voice it deserves. In addition to all the media also share this to the logical indian page on fb. They do a good job highlighting such topics. Media reporting this is only gonna get shot down by this sub calling them presstitutes or something, and western media called trying to malign india's growth story. ;There's not much of a link between mercury and cancer. I'd stay away from those fish, though, as the current levels are definitely high enough to cause neurotoxicity and to be a serious teratogen (Google Minimata disease). For the love of god, tell pregnant women in particular not to eat those fish.;>The fifth in our series of articles on Global Compact companies examines Unilever's response when caught dumping toxic mercury waste from a thermometer factory in Southern India earlier this year. The Anglo-Dutch company recently closed the factory. Community members, however, allege that the multinational has downplayed the dangers of mercury and misled the public in an attempt to cover up the truth. Indian journalist Nityanand Jayaraman reports for CorpWatch.

I'm not shocked.

I'm Dutch, I know what kind of people end up working at high positions in Unilever. They're narcissistic rich kids who studied in Leiden, go to the same fraternity and make sure to hand each other nice jobs after graduation.

We in the first world own the world's giant corporations and export the dirty jobs that render the local environment uninhabitable to the third world.

I kind of feel like opening linkedin and sending some of these guys some links to this post to see what their company does.;Mercury as such is not known to cause cancer - compounds like mercuric chloride are possible carcinogens though. Check if these reports are testing for elemental mercury or for mercuric chloride as well.;Crosspost this to /r/worldnews as well. You never know, it might catch on.;I mailed this story - linking this Reddit post - to Gawker media. ;>A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

Keep this in mind the next time you people say NGOs are against davalapment in the nation.;This is some Erin Brokovich level shit man. Spreading this through my network! MNCs should not get away with these things.;I remember Padmini swaminathan talk about this issue and about how she was looking at the number of people who were afflicted by cancer and how many of them were women and and widows who had taken on the jobs after the men in the family succumbed to Cancer.

Major Edit : You could get in touch with Medico Friend Circle too, they are a bunch of medicos who had in the past dealt with Bhopal survivors too. ;When I saw this post first time, I was quiet sure that this will get ignored in our usual randia drama. 

But now I feel like this sub has some potential.;Head of TOI is a close family member. I will send this to him. ;Look the only way to help your village is to draw a direct line between cancer caused to HLL operation. These will be production methods and waste disposal. You will need to get a group of people that can help collect, categorize and test samples collected.  This will take time so be ready for a long fight. After you have conclusive proof of these data you have collected and it points to HLL then proceed . it may also be possible your data may point to a completely different source of these cancer. 

So, first get your data. Secondly establish the correct link between the source and effect. Thirdly don't make accusation over social media without doing the first two steps. You can open your self to legal litigation for a organization that can afford to tie you up in the court system before you even start. So, best of luck. ;> my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

I don't understand your numbers. 250 over 5 years would be 50 deaths per year for 5000 people or 1% per year. And you're saying 5% (over 5 years) is 8500% greater than 0.05%.

In any case, I don't think that the Indian death rate for cancer could be as low as 0.05% unless the people were normally dying young from other diseases. Since cancer isn't easily curable, if large amounts of the population live into old age, 1/3 of them are going to die of cancer, which would give a much higher number than 0.05% per year.;have tweeted and retweeted , get the word out;Palani, i know the little town at the foothills. I've lived there too. Good bless the people.;Can I ask if the mercury is in the form of methyl mercury? If that is the case, there is a way to estimate concentrations very accurately if needed.

;Harmful substances to developing a cancer is cadmium, lead, radioactive waste. Mercury I do not think a direct causative agent of cancer. Famous in mercury poisoning is Minamata disease in Japan, it is a disease that affects the human nervous.

Moreover, dying of cancer is associated with not dying of other causes..so you need to identify unusual and early presentation of cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death (about 30%), basically because people live longer these days.;Mercury poisoning is (was?) a big issue in Canada too

Here is a news item on same

Here is a research paper on same

https://www.mcgill.ca/msr/msr-volume-4/mercury-poisoning-grassy-narrows;5% is super low rate of cancer-especially if they are over 50. If anything, it would seem to prevent cancer. You need to check your numbers. ;Mods could you share this on twitter ?

Preferably after verification of the facts (via PM maybe?);5% cancer mortality rate seems extremely low. Could it be that people in your village live longer on average than the average Indian? That could make them more likely to die of cancer in old/older age instead of viruses and such. Men have a 45% cancer rate in the West probably because we live longer. It could also be a random effect or genetic dispossessions in a huge village family. I would strongly recommend you test the water and then write all the names of the dead down. And also their family lines and where they lived. Right now we can't say for certain what causes it. And suing the company responsible for it requires better proof. We can't rule out a second source of pollution either without more tests of the water and the ground.;Please try contacting MC mehta or Center for public interest litigation

We were independent of the other parts of India till British took it. We were never under Mughal empire. We have fought and defeated them 17 times. We treat all Indians equally here in north east.

Adding go my comment 
 All the people commenting on hatred about each other caste , state , religion I wanna ask you people what we should do? From your viewpoint I guess first we have to fight state wise. Then the winner state will get divided into religion and fight again. Then the winner team gets divided based on caste and fight again. Then I think all problems will be solved. I believe our elder generation had made some mistakes but do we have to follow them blindly? It's 2020 . Get out your mind from colour, religion , caste and try to see a person as a human being. 
We are the educated generation we should at least try to make a change and educate our elders. But no we like to argue, fight over baseless useless things. Busy sipping gao mut. Please I request again please see everybody as human do not judge by caste state religion.

I bet the last Saturday festivities with all the clapping nonsense would be another conduit too. 

In short, we fucked up mate, we ain’t no western country that has resources to take care of it’s citizens in a lockdown, we area third world country and lockdown is the last thing we needed. 

All we had to do was absolutely copy South Korea and Taiwan, masks for all, washing hands often, social distancing and making sure public transportation and malls have less thats 30% capacity at all times by extending work timings and last but not least preventing unecessary air travel like all the idiot tourists flying to Italy and London, and also enforcing strict quarantine measures for incoming passengers, indian or otherwise . 

Simple as that, instead with the cheap labour we have, we didn’t even have masks in spite of having all the time in the world( Jan was when this began) and now lockdown as if that that is the solution( it’s not)"

People have been fleeing all these 3 countries for decades now. (Leaving everything behind for the promise of nothing, I wonder why they'd do that.) 
And this is a promise from the 2014 manifesto so its definitely not a surprise to any of the other parties. They're just trying to milk it for its worth and apparently, some people are blind. 

Reasons why Muslims from Pak, AF, BL can be excluded without violation Article 14:
1) They don't form a persecuted minority in any of the 3 Islamic Republics in question.
2) Except for Ahmadiyas in Pak (who chose to live in Pakistan when presented both options during Partition)
And 3) Rohingyas, who Bangladesh has also declared to be a security concern.

So bar these 2 communities the citizens of these countries do not seek refuge and come to india. If they do move its for better opportunities. 


I challenge you to name one country that has zero grounds on which people are tested before they are given citizenship. Ever wondered why the most developed countries have low population? Shouldn't every Tom dick and Harry be moving there after checking the HDI list?

It was about preventive measures one should take against COVID-19. It mentioned the precautions were from UNICEF and one should follow them religiously. I don't remember most of the points but few of them were - 

1. Refraining from eating ice-cream and other cold foods will prevent the virus from spreading.
2. Drinking warm water regularly will kill the virus.
3. The virus will not survive for more than 12 hours in hot weather like ours and hence one must come out in the day when the sun is out. 
4. Do some breathing exercises and it will force the virus out of your throat and subsequently it will be excreted from the body.

I was taken aback when I read it. Now this friend of mine is an engineer and is studying for UPSC. He is also quite active religiously.

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a “daredevil selfie” when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 

The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.

**Actual Events:**

Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngsters’ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.

**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.

All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 

I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.


This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 

For Pranita.

Edit: Guys please, if something here offends you then please let me know, but please do not downvote this, we dont want her to be remembered this way, we want to get the true story out.

Thankyou all for believing this story.

Thankyou guys so much once again, and thanks to the mods for being so cooperative. Thankyou ScoopWhoop for owning up to the mistake and not ignoring the truth when it came out. This post is now being circulated all over facebook and my college thanks to the efforts of reddit India.
 
 To Pranita, 
I hope you are in a better place, the college will forever miss seeing your radiating smile everyday.

Do something worthy for once. Copy this and make it famous. 

Edit:As much I hate you,Scoopwhoop. 

 Thank you for finally reporting the truth. 

# Satyamev Jayathe. ;/u/ForPranitaThrowaway You and all people fighting to get correct version out of story , it may not be in your agenda but can you guys file RTI and get information about accidental deaths reported at said place ?  Pranita and her friends were sitting on rock and flown away by a giant wave. Hence there should be demarcation/warning signs to avoid future tragedies.;NLUJ has the worst luck. I've heard stories of raped girls not telling their families what truly happened. Now this. My best friend (who studies in NLUJ) cried her eyes out when she heard of this, specially the bullshit selfies crap. She apparently was just sitting on the rocks. When the high tide came, everybody else could hold on to something while she just has moss. I hope TOI fixes their story.;As a Nova Scotian. I know all to well about life being whisked away by the Sea.

We have our own beach deathtrap called Peggy's Cove. Unfortunately people will sit on the dark rocks and then disappear into the ocean.

Sorry about your friend. ;Sorry for your loss.

Honestly, even if she had died by slipping while taking a selfie, people die by slipping and falling all the time. It doesn't mean a lack of intelligence.;Why pick just the TOI for your title when The Hindu has done the same too?;All my sympathies are with you. And I hate these news sites too. Scoopwhoop should be demolished. 

Anyway, for a situation like this, someone can come up and say everything is uncorroborated about the incident. If the beach warnings were uncorroborated, even the part about ""she was not taking a selfie"" can be called out as uncorroborated. 

I was thinking about how can we prove she was not taking a selfie? We can't. Unless someone in authority(like the cops etc) goes around and gathering witnesses. Which we all know is not gonna happen as this has already been tagged a ""natural death"" cause by the cops.

I have been to Gokarna a couple of times in the past. And it does get several rounds of high tides at any time of the day. I have no idea but I suppose it is because of the unusual topography of the place. And any sensible person would not linger around the water when there are warnings being displayed. Yes, they do have warning signs posted whenever there are major changes in the water level predicted.

It is really not sensible to be in the sea water unless you are geared to be there at that point. Watch any Youtube video with the search tag ""surfer safety in sea water"". ;Here is a word cloud of every comment in this thread, as of this time: http://i.imgur.com/YwHUnPn.jpg

As for Pranita. It was amazing to know you out of our whatever little interactions. Learned quite a few things, especially about smart work. Lots of prayers and strength to the family. ;Seems like Indian press is trying to make a narrative of Western-influenced narcissism of young students. (You know because there were never such a thing as narcissistic Indians before);You should write an article  about this on Medium.com. Take some quotes from your friends and include it in the article. 

Well,  TOI is a propaganda reporting station. If you tell mourning family members that their daughter /grand daughter is died because of taking selfie they will believe it because they seek some reasoning for their unexpected loss. That's exploitation of vulnerable family to support their own  propaganda. If they did not provide any evidence then I am with you. 

Can you confirm one thing?  If she wasn't taking selfie did you guys (survived friends) locate her mobile phone from hotel room or any other place which might help some extent for your Version. ;Here you go - http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Remember-The-Law-Student-Who-Died-While-Clicking-A-Selfie-In-Gokarna-The-Story-Is-Apparently-False/

Ditto OneIndia.

Secondly, no one would report this from hearsay. This must be the version the police have given out. 

Thirdly, the Hindu article says she was clicking the selfie NEAR the lighthouse, not ON it.

And the Aaj Tak report is an entirely different one!

Really sorry for your loss, but also compelled to say your ire is misdirected. If you need someone to talk to. please feel free to reach out to me.;All my sympathies to you, your friend and the family of the poor girl. Do take down the picture of the FIR (letter, not the printed copy) with your names on it and re-upload it after censoring that line.

 Man they joking right! This literally sounds like how movies do fake encounter. I don't believe it.;[ye saare milke humko pagal bna re h, madarchod ke bacche](https://youtu.be/XXqcDZsXWEQ);There is no rule of law in this country.

-A  women gets gang raped and burnt alive.
-An MLA tries to spin a communal narrative.
-An MP calls for mob lynching with complete disregard for law.
-Media makes this  a TRP spectacle, all the while ignoring similar rapes throughout the country.
-Police kill the accused without any due process.

This entire episode is so disgusting.; *  Admitting crime to the police is not the same as admitting in front of a court of justice. We might just have killed four innocent scapegoats while the real culprits might be roaming free.
 *  People saying that this saved the time of our judicial system don't understand that the whole and sole purpose of establishing a judicial system is to deliver the right judgement after carefully evaluating all facets and evidences.;[deleted];Only after giving them a fair chance to defend themselves in courts can you hold them guilty, if not tomorrow they can pick you up for driving past the wrong location at the wrong time(or for coming in the sights of someone powerful) and call you guilty, and then have you killed. How uneducated and stupid are the ones cheering at this outcome?;A lot of people on Twitter are appreciating and encouraging the encounter without ever realizing it only gives more power to the already corrupt state system. The last thing we would want is the State sponsoring killings with the support of the people. Not really surprising that the society that appreciates state sponsored murders without due judicial process breeds a lot of rapists.;This is not good.   
This is happening time and time again.   
Fake encounters are not the answer and it blatantly undermines the legal institution.   
   
This will just address the temporary outrage of our populace with a very short memory.;Why were all 4 accused being taken to the crime scene? 

Weren't proper precautions taken by the cops so that they don't 'try to escape' on their way to the scene? Like tie their hands and legs or something? 

Isn't it the responsibility of the cops to ensure the accused make it to the courts?

At worst, this is a 'fake' encounter and at best, it shows police incompetence.;Now what ?  
The pressure is taken off the police, government , judiciary and what about the 117,451 rape cases which are pending in the country, and 28,750 cases which were brought to trial?  
lets kill them too because a rape is rape how are these cases any different from the one that happen in Hyderabad .  
everyday there are more than 100 rape related cases reported in India, The NCRB report of 2006 mentions that about 71% rape crimes go unreported in India what about them .  
it may be an unpopular opinion but it is what it is encounter is no way a solution and those who are thinking that the justice is served is just satisfying there ego, true justice is done when these kind of crimes are stopped but that cannot be done with out a systemic change , i clearly believe it has lot to do with parenting , schooling , society, friendships

when someone talk to girl/boy all(at leat majority) parents think is that they are in love and next thing they will do is elope and marry so its a taboo for their kid to talk to a girl/boy

when a teacher see a girl and boy talk in school or college they only see it in a wrong way and i goes same with society

when your friend comments on a person in a derogative way it is your job to say that he is wrong, you being silent is same as agreeing with him

unless the relation between different genders is normalised one can never be sensitive to other gender problems, when they know what others gender go through they become more considerate and understanding.

And we cannot really blame judiciary for the delay in delivery of justice they can only play with in the rules/laws it is the job of the government to bring in strict laws amend existing CRPC/IPC bring in FTC(fast track courts) .

I wanted to post my views on other social media platforms but after see the celebrations of the encounter all i can see is only backlash so let's talk more about actual solution rather than knee jerk reactions.;I call BS. A fake encounter for sure. “Recreating crime scene” ? Seriously ? This is going to please the people but at the same time nothing is going to be done to prevent any future crimes. Back to square one it seems.;Reports here are that they pelted stones at the cops and the cops fired in self defence. Some reports are saying that they even snatched weapons from cops for their escape. 🤷‍♂️;I know this is very sensitive case,I sympathize with the victim and her family.I've heard her last call recording with family.it is a horrific crime.I want justice not fake encounters.

Hope human Rights commission takes this case. This is Clearly a fake encounter. We should be ashamed if things go like this. Tommorow they can get an innocent person killed without a trial,or at least a hearing. why we need Court and judiciary and human Rights if police starts deliveres ""justice"" based on who they believe is a criminal and innocent.smh;Smells of a fake encounter.

Conspiracy theory: What if the police were trying to protect some bigwig who is the actual culprit? Arrested random guys and killed them before the truth comes out, and the case will now be closed?;I really dont think this is the way forward... if it comes to mob justice and encounter verdicts , then as a democractic nation , as civilized nation , we HAVE FAILED !!

IF you need to see real punishment , strengthen the DAMN FUCKING JUDUCIARY... ABOLISH CORRUPTION IN IT!!!;Not good! People in Twitter are calling this a #JusticeForPriyanka and celebrating Telengana Police. True justice would have been fasttracking judicial process and improving women safety through targeted policies. If anything this douses the fire on genuine protests and closes the lid on Police reforms . A missed opportunity for genuine policy changes. Such a shame!;One of these days, people in power are gonna frame some whistle-blower on rape only to be killed in such encounter, normalising and celebrating this is doing more bad than good.;Jayalalitha style justice by KCR.;Disgusting! Prime example of how public euphoria turns into covert executive action.

Time and again, its been proved that brutal punishments doesn't disincentivize such behavior.

But the country wanted to hide its own guilty conscience of poor laws and security and took the easy way out.

The recommendations of Justice Verma Commission Report are still largely not implemented. But hey, when public servants themselves lose faith in law the answer to crime is with another crime.;Yeah this is 100% extra judicial killing. Their story looks like a kid telling his mom how some bird snatched candy from box and not him. Why the fuck would you take all four of them to crime scene in complete blackout and you can not see shit? Now the question is do we support this act or oppose it? While some may say they got what they deserve and rightly so but still access to law is every persons birth right. What should have happened was they should have been hanged by completion of due process of the law within a year or two. If we regularise extra judicial killings then given the sorry state of institutions in India we may end up with something murky on our hands where Police will decide who will die. We all know how corrupt our police is.;Having tougher and more stringent laws is worthless if the implementation is shoddy. The existing laws are enough. What is extremely poor is the law and order situation. Tougher laws have never deterred crime. What deters criminals is the prospect of swift justice and a functional Police and Judiciary. Unfortunately, our polity and society thinks that merely making laws in Parliament is enough. We have always been more concerned about debating morality and justice than actually providing it. 

Lee Kuan Yew was right when he said - ""The Indians only talk, the Chinese do"";Wait..what?

Was it 100% proven they were guilty?

Also, why would they try to escape? They would know they are going to get killed, right? They were probably more safer in police custody.

Either they are too idiotic. Or something's wrong.

Both have a 50% probability.;Is there no requirement for cops to video document this part of the investigation?
The suspects weren't in hand cuffs? And took them at 3am? Seriously? 
This is surely looking like a cover up to hide the real culprits.....how are people saying justice has been served;I am ashamed to see folks celebrating this as an act of heroism and what not. Where the fuck were they when unnao culprit Kuldeep Sengar did so much shit.;whattttttt? there is no way this is true.😳

edit: wtf, TOI reported on this too. This 100% just reeks of a set up. So all 4 of these shitheads decide to bounce when they know they're implicated in a high profile case & all 4 get gunned down? Movies have more believable encounter stories than this. 
Don't get me wrong, these assholes definitely deserved to die but this literally does nothing to actually address the issue. This quartet got offed bc they were random lorry drivers. Can we expect the same ""encounter"" if the next horrendous gang rape is done by a group of well connected businessmen/politicians' sons?;Remeber the Ryan international murder case where the accused was a bus conductor who had 'confessed' under police pressure. Everyone was calling for the conductor to be hanged.

When the CBI investigated the case, it turned out that the murderer was a 11th grade classmate of the victim. That is why we have a judicial system.

*Let 10 guilty walk free, than one innocent be convicted*;What the actual fuck is happening in this country. Are we becoming a parody of _Bollywood_?;As usual, the downtrodden have no access to the judiciary. The accussed deserve to be punished for such a heinous crime but the process must go through the courts. 

Senior BJP leaders (mostly upper caste/Brahmins) with rape accusations walk freely with full protection from the law and no media trials either. What happened in Unnao is equally gruesome and the victim deserves full justice.;How can they pelt stones if they were supposed to be cuffed? Police got something to hide and they can use popular emotions to get away.

The other case of a burnt body will never be solved.;This is a farzi encounter cant believe that people are actually praising this shit 

Mostly a move by a politician to defuse the tension;This is like taking aspirin for a brain tumour. Will make you happy for the moment but the real problem is still there.;A reminder to people who are happy about this encounter. Time and time police have done fake encounter of innocent people for promotion, money or cover up. This is not law or justice, this is retribution and should not be painted as otherwise. 

Also, Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.;It's the police version of events so it must be the gospel truth. /s;All this shows is that if you get caught and the public is in a rage, then you will be killed. 

It does absolutely nothing for women's safety in india! 

This does NOT solve the problem. It merely delays thinking about it untill the next one.;If you kill a killer, the number of killer stays the same.

This is for sure a fake encounter. How can 4 guys run away from police? That too when this case was getting media attention from all over the nation.

This is definitely not good. Definitely not good.;Such a high profile case. The whole country is watching. It is not a case which comes to 6th page for a day and disappears. Who authorized this? Seems to me like the decision came from wayyy up.;I can't believe even leftists/liberals are celebrating this.

What in the ever living fuck is wrong with you guys?!

This is a fucking extra judicial killing.

We have been hoodwinked off justice. Now we'll never truly know whether these were really the culprits or just some random blokes the police pinned this on to save some prominent people. Not saying that's the case but it is a possibility.

And what compelled the police to shoot down unarmed suspects? If they ran away, fucking catch them goddamn it!;The cops tried recreating a scene at 3 AM. Anyone from police background here who could verify that such odd timings are normal ?

It wasn't proven that they were the real culprits. A court pronounces you guilty, not the police. 

For all we know the cops may have caught the wrong chaps by coercion or bribe and the chaps threatened to spill the beans when they realised that they would be lynched if they ever come out in public. 

Even assuming that they are the real rapists and murderers, what's the precedent being set here? Hey we are cops, we will not prevent a crime, we will shirk all responsibility there and when that crime happens and people raise voices we will give them Bollywood style justice. 

This thing is fucked up on so many levels. In a country where you don't know what can you be imprisoned for - Sudha Bharadwaj, villagers of Bhandra - cops getting a leeway to shoot you is absolutely scary. It's only a matter of time before it comes for the middle class now.;There's something really fishy about this. Afaik the police they're armed with age old 303 rifles. 

Maybe someone with a little more knowledge can comment on this? What's the standard issue armaments for the Indian police?;This is so fucked up. The fake encounter and also the dumbfucks who're praising it. I sincerely hope those responsible for this crime don't get away with it.;>The accused snatched weapon and fired on Police. 

So, the accused already knew how to use a gun. And there was no safety in it.;As usual most of social media is rejoicing. I dont mind that but when people are calling it justicefordisha it is ticking me off.;Holy crap, police expect people to believe this?....this should be in the dictionary for the meaning of fake encounter;Dafuk..
Has this really happened? 
Are we doing movie plots in real life now? 
No trial, no courts , direct justice?

For a sec I think who is  more criminal..them for commiting the crime or the police for killing them in an ""encounter ""...

Bc Kya hora hai hai desh me..;This is wrong on so many levels. But what do you expect when the majority of the public and even elected MPs were calling for public lynching.

They are not even trying to make it look plausible. They know this will be lauded by majority of the public.

It is a win-win for the police and ruling party. The police who were being blamed for their incompetency until yesterday have now in public eye become heroes who have brought the perpetrators to justice. And for the ruling party, it sends out a message that the KCR government has no mercy for rapists. 

I, for one, support capital punishment but only after due judicial process and if it is proven by unmistakeable evidence that the accused were in fact the culprits. But this is cold blooded murder.
How do we know for sure the accused were in fact the real culprits? How do we know that the police did not find scapegoats to pacify the public? Or what if they know who did it and they are trying to save them? Guess we will never know.

The country is on a downward spiral. This is what happens when we elect hate mongering bigots into power. After all the fish stinks from the head.;People who do bad things deserve to be punished. However, there's gotta be a proper trial, legal proceedings. If not, faith in the law just diminishes and everything turns to chaos. It might not be as wrong as what the criminals do, but it's wrong. Very wrong.;What if one of the accused is proven to be innocent tomorrow based on some CCTV footage that he there at some other location during the crime?

Instead of fixing our dysfunctional judiciary and police, they are looking for shortcuts."

Not sure why you people think it makes women look good here. They're openly showing everyone that they're exploiting a law meant for their protection against the police in ridiculous ways.

Let me ask what happens if someone is literally getting mobbed to death but a ring of women is surrounding the mob. What happens, do the police just stand down while the murderers are escorted to safety by the women? Absurd.;I.... I don't think the law works that way. If I remember correctly, if you have atleast one policewoman they can arrest her but they have to detain them separately in a women exclusive place. 

And the law also mentions that in exceptional cases, you can arrest women and there is no list of exceptional cases given, so I think it's very subjective."

Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement of a nationwide lockdown for three weeks to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa had declared a one-day relaxation in the state on Tuesday evening.

On Tuesday evening, the Karnataka CM made the announcement. He said, ""**Whoever wants to leave Bengaluru or come in, let them do it tonight (Tuesday night).** From Wednesday, stricter measures would be adopted against violators.""

""We have seen many people on the streets despite the lockdown. **We realise many want to go to their hometowns or want to come to Bengaluru for Ugadi.** I have already requested people to celebrate this in as simple a manner as possible. Despite the curfew situation, you are still seeing people on the streets. For their own health, these people must not do that,"" he added.;[removed];Hot take: I don't think it's fair to focus on this incident specifically when all major religious centers were open as of that time and the government itself was still not taking the disease seriously. I think this is another ugly facet of Islamophobia masquerading as an acceptable target. Also, it is just plain unhelpful to be heaping vitriol on anyone at this point, and demonstrably has been sometimes misguided (remember when everyone was super mad at tha lady from Bangalore for allegedly fleeing after being told she was covid19 positive but then it turned out she was innocent after all). 

If we wanna talk about religion as a pull for large gatherings that's a valid topic but there is a distinct undercurrent of hatred when people talk about the Nizamuddin thing in particular that speaks less of public health concerns and more of scapegoating.;Nizamuddin Dargah and Jamat are entirely two different entities. Please don't mix these.;Don't get me wrong guys, maybe this gathering  after the lockdown was planned. They wanted people to come out so this will give the brainwashed hindus a chance to call out muslims and than these same Islamic leaders will add fuel by telling their believers that how Hindus are coming after you and your faith. Then the same hindu-muslim cycle repeats. Sometimes I think that all these religious leaders of different religions are actually friends with each other and pulling the chords from behind. It's like their oligarchy.;Is that a Jojos reference?;Y'all got 1.4 BILLION people. Yet yer infection rate is hella low.

It should be common place regardless of cast or religion or gender to have basic etiquette and compassion towards others (human beings, animals).

 cause of his duty and the other reason being - he does not know them. 

That is the whole thing here. Almost any Hindu/Muslim will do the same for another Muslim/Hindu **whom they know**. 

Only when the other person is someone whom we don't know - do things get out of hand. Even when someone is rioting, you will often see the rioting crowd go a certain distance and then get down to business (arson, lynching whatever). One of the reasons is to be the unknown face in another area, but the other reason is someone doing something bad to someone you know very well, is actually quite difficult.

White tigers are bred despite having a myriad of health problems and not living nearly as long as normal tigers. Kidney and spine issues, crossed optic nerves etc. White tigers is a sign of a bad zoo (unless it's a sanctuary rescuing abused or neglected animals, which is where the abysmally few lucky ones end up). All the cubs in this picture likely have similar health issues. 

Iirc, for every white tiger, roughly thirty others were discarded (sold to roadside zoos, circuses or straight up killed/sold to people practicing traditional medicine). And then I haven't even touched on the white tigers that don't have the right proportions, who are also discarded.

**Tera** byte comes from the sanskrit word *trayodash* which means ""13"". However, when the Britishers were planning to loot away the priceless artifacts from India, they also had their evil eyes on the number ""13""(*trayodash*). It was Nehru, who was also friends with Mountbatten, who secretly planned to keep the ""1"" from the number ""13"" so that the Britishers don't get bad luck on the way, all for his friends' sake. The ""1"" always stayed in India and brought all the bad luck for the next 67 years (until 2014). Thus, although he gave them ""terah"", what they actually got was only **12**, hence the word **TERA** which stands for 10^12.

You make friends with your conductors very fast when you have an 1.5 hour one-way commute every day.

I used to take NMMT/BEST (700/AC-700) or TMT buses from Borivali. I still remember I used to pay INR 35 (AC-700) for a single journey ticket (Borivali to Kasarvadavli) and then when the business kicked-in, BEST began shooting the price in a slow and steady manner. I think I paid around \~INR 50-55 (may be INR 70 even, not sure, this was years back) the last time I traveled in AC-700. You'd be surprised but the Thane AC buses (don't remember if it was NMMT or TMT; I think TMT) charged INR 25 for the same journey! That too for a relatively lengthy period of time, despite the hike in AC-700's ticket costs.

&#x200B;

A side note: the ST buses were the BEST experience! Especially the red colour one that is so famous for its speed and maneuvering, it's got a class for itself. It's called ""lal dabba."" Borivali to Kasarvadavali in 30-35 minutes. This was back during the class of 2010 (August) and right until October 2012.

&#x200B;

Sad truth of justice system;It is incredibly difficult for women to get justice for workplace harassment. My friend was working in a IT company in Bangalore. She had a sleazy manager. It started with verbal assault first. Commenting about her body in lewd manner, not just in office, even outside the campus. Later he started putting her in late night shifts and only she and the manager would be present in the whole floor. He would come to her cubicle and will start talking and even touched her inappropriately. One day he called her into a conference room and closed it. And that's when she lost it and made a formal complaint to the very specific department of HR that handles workplace harassment. 


She and the manager were called in for questioning. Nothing happens for a few days and then she was called in by the HR. She was being put in performance improvement plan with a chance of being ""terminated"" at the end of it if not successfully finished. And that too under the same manager she complained. She put her papers and luckily found a job with in the notice period. 


I don't endorse the public outing of past sexual assaults in twitter or other social media without any substantial evidence or the lack of intent to legally  pursue things. All that does is put a mark on a guy without any proper way to defend himself. But a lot can be done about workplace harassments. It is difficult to prove things. At least the company could support the victim by providing her with a safe space, removing the accused from her chain of reports or transfer to other locations etc. 


Only take severe actions like suspension or termination if the accused was found guilty. Keep the identity of the accused also hidden until the charges are proven. So even if it was a false accusation, he will come out with minimum damage. 


But when women find it extremely difficult to get justice for workplace harassment, this poster looks condescending and unsupportive.;All we ask are neutral laws and proper investigation for every accusation and media to shut the fuck up because ""innocent until proven guilty"", no matter what!;False cases do happen. But why is the poster at a company workplace? It does seem way out of context and honestly, a bit intimidating, especially for, say, a low level employee.;they probably had an incident or two in their office.;We can do a lot of betterment for men and women both and battle these criminal minds who twist-use law for thier benefits only if we overcome from shitty topics such as religion, cast, nationalism etc;Ah a non political post in India subreddit. THANK YOU.;Sure ma man. 

This is valid in other countries.

But here in india? The place which has been called the rape capital of the world?

It's such a non issue, that this type of poster feels almost out of place.

Get your shit together swiggy.;I am not taking side with the perpetrators, I am just saying that proper laws are there in place to bring those perpetrators to justice but  “only a few false accusations” can dilute the perception of general public or employees in corporate setting. 

I am strictly only commenting on the photo uploaded here and on the aspect of false accusation in this kind of offence.

In no way I support or demand for lesser punishment for the offenders, they should deserve “termination” and “non fit for employability”. Since the quantum of punishment should be this high we also need to safeguard the  non offenders and check the the misuse of this law. Which demands that there should be if not equal then equivalent punishment be served to the false accusers.;Yea but by the time the dust settles and you not convicted of any wrong doing, your reputation will have been effected grossly.;False accusations of sexual assault should have the same punishment as actual counts.;The punishment for both false accuser or harasser must at least be par to each other;What is the context?;Do you want people to be ( even more) scared of reporting harrasment? Because that is how you get people to be scared of reporting harassment.;Very subtle. 

I cant speak for stats in India given that according to official government statistics you are 15 times more likely to be raped in American than India but America for example has a 2 to 7% rate of false sexual harassment claims. 

I think this whole false reporting thing is blown out of proportion.;Shall explain why this poster is bad by few questions 

Does it mean that, when there is no proof of harassment, the women will be punished if she complains? 

Does it mean when nobody is looking, a harasser can touch inappropriately and threaten employee that there is no proof and as such she will be punishable if she complains;I get what they're trying to do, but this really isn't cool. It's threatening and likely to put people off from reporting cases of sexual assault.;swiggy looks like a terrible place to work in.;This should be a law .;never knew that; but its right.;You know if you put up just one poster without the others around the office, you remove context and completely misrepresent the awareness being spread?

There are multiple posters of sexual harassment should be reported, of the ombudsman for the company, what constitutes sexual harassment etc;Attended POSH training in new company. It was a town hall meeting 300+ people. Trainer was asked how many claims were false, it was around 25-30%. 

Regarding punishment, it is based on the seriousness of the claim and any damage done in that time. It can be a warning, termination from the job and fine / jail term too.;Always creeped out by people who act like false accusations are a bigger deal or more common than actual sexual harassment. Do they also have anti sexual harassment posters up / posters encouraging coming forward or is this up just to create a chilling atmosphere for reporting actual harassment?;Imagine walking into a police station that says, ""false cases of credit card fraud are punishable”. 

Why the fuck can’t these moronic companies come up with a suitable way to discreetly investigate all complaints. They are soo good at hiding their sex offender higher-ups anyway.;This is disgusting. Only in such a society as ours messages like these are encouraged! Harassment is real. Sexual harassment against women is real. The number of these cases is far far higher than false accusations. Can’t believe this is getting upvoted.;India has a legit problem with sexual assault, and the answer is to pass legislation to protect men from false accusations? 

The irony is fookin palpable;Wow never seen one for actual sexual harassment in my life even once! 

It's crazy to think how things that mostly affect men are put into light so quickly.

Never have I once seen support for sexually harassed victims in any of these tech bro fucking companies. Goddamit

PS this is not about which issue is bigger. It's about hypocrisy.;Where is the equal size poster that say rape is also punishable? Grumble.;@ those who feel that false accusations deserve no publicity / punishment 

Would you be okay with a GoI line of logic that said that most Muslim accused are guilty of terrorism and that only a small percentage of Muslims are falsely charged with it?;I like how this is tagged as 'Non-political'. Also it's laughable how Swiggy is pretending as if false cases are a bigger deal or occur more often then actual cases of workplace harassment.
The poster is so patronizing, I wouldn't want to work at a company that treats it's employees like idiots.;It doesn't really work in India actually. 
People don't care if you were acquitted, if you were blamed that's all the society would need to judge you guilty.;> ""The law exists for your protection, not for settling scores"";Wow this post has attracted a lot of closet rapists. False rape accusations should be punished. But NOT by commiting an actual rape. You people sick. Get mental help.;The idea that false sexual assault accusations in Indian workplaces is more of a problem than sexual harassment itself, especially towards women, is so laughable to me. This poster is absurd but it’s already sitting on top of this subreddit because somehow young men on the internet have convinced themselves that false accusations are more of a threat than actual sexual harassment. 

Maybe workplaces should consider putting up posters targeting men like ‘don’t make sexual jokes or comments’ or ‘don’t persistently call a co worker after hours’ and see how condescending that is.

All this poster does is create an environment of Intimidation.;I don't see what's wrong ?;r/mensrights;More like if you can't prove it, don't speak out;As much as i believe that false claimers should be punished, this seems wrong. There is an excessive amount of women facing sexual harassment, whereas false claims are a rarity. This looks like they want the women who actually experience harassment to remain quiet, as these things can be hard to prove already, and with punishment hanging on their head, they would most likely be silent against everything that happens to them. Hell with you, swiggy.;What has the world come to accusing delivery guys of sexual harassment because they were slightly late;My friend was in a very bitter and toxic relationship but when he tried to breakup his gf filled a rape case against him (break up after sex before marriage is considered rape) and I know what things he and his family suffered through. He also attempted suicide multiple times. The problem in India is that people don't think about how men suffer mentally and financially because of such laws when they also have the burden of responsibility to feed their families. This biased law is never highlighted by media (biased because women can break up but if men do he is rapist)

 Any case of false accusation should result in stringest punishment and the woman should be made to pay compensation to the man;False accusation is a real problem, but SEXUAL HARASSMENT is the biggest problem because it can kill you, scar you for life and Men who do it always get away with it.;looks like swiggy is saying that they will give you a hard time if you speak against harassment in company space... pathetic people.

Edit: peopl, I can read what they've written over there but understand the psychology. Women already don't come out often and tell about misconduct in working place in fear of losing job, now on top of that, instead of encouraging women you're saying that - ""think twice before your complain about misconduct because if it's proven false, we gonna give you hard times""

It's borderline victim blaming and encouraging harassers because we all know how difficult it is to prove sexual harrassment in India. Keep in mind that false accusations are negligible in number compared to number of misconduct in working place, so, raising awareness about it is not THAT important.;[removed];Rainmaker used to be one of my clients. One of the organisations helping with the issue of Sexual Harrasment in India.;Wait!  Swiggy is in India now?

Indians and Pakistanis both realize that the Arabs/Emiratis are neither of their friends. The familiarity of South Asian always trumps the outright cruelty and sometimes-inhumanity of the people who run these countries. Indians and Pakistanis are both aware that they share a lower rung on the country's ladder, and that the ladder can be kicked aside at any moment. They don't necessarily stick together, but somehow when you look into one another's eyes you feel that solidarity.

Many people glorify the idea of life in the Gulf, but forget how stark it is for many thousands and millions even. These people look well off I guess, but I don't think anyone can live in Dubai without feeling what I'm talking about.

I hope someday India and Pakistan find some common enemy in South Asia who could unite us.

I was taught that in Islam, lifting the bier (kaandha dena) is considered a very spiritual and respectful act, so much so that in some burials and janazahs you can find literal strangers scrambling to carry the bier of any passing-by Muslim's body even for just a couple of seconds. I remember my mother insisting on me to support the bier of any death ritual we go to. You'll also notice in the video how people are rushing to carry the bier, and how folks keep circulating their positions by giving everyone a chance. I haven't verified this news, but I'm assuming some Mulsims couldn't bear the disrespect of nobody giving shoulder to their dead neighbour which is why they may have done this.;This should be brought to attention of main media channels and shown on tv.;Such a welcome video (except the man dying part) in these days of doom and gloom.;The media will never show this. Don't be surprised guys if someone manipulated the video and share it on Whatsapp with caption ""Muslim mob throwing Hindu man due to corona fear"";/r/HumansBeingBros;India for you !;I'm all for this but wtf happened to social distancing. There is a reason that others did not come out.;Mera India! ❤️;Dead body can still spread virus right ?;[removed];It is not something that should be appreciated. Infact I think it was a pretty foolish move. There was a reason why his bier was not lifted by his relatives. At this moment where we have thousands of cases coming up everyday, it seems like the best move although it sounds harsh. I don't understand how people are not understanding the importance of social distancing.;In the event of actual covid deaths, it should be handled by government. Burial done by people with protective equipment and lime.;I love every bit of this;The same thing I was discussing with my wife the other day. In UK unconfirmed reports say that the Gov is deciding on mass cremation irrespective of religious rights to a burial or a cremation. Apparently in  Italy they are doing mass cremations as people are not readily available to carry out these duties. I reminded her that for muslims it's the religious duty to partake in funerals and they would do that if they were allowed in the lockdown. It may well be the same people they harbour extreme hate against end up performing their last rites.;It’s sad to see someone so dear die, during this pandemic irrespective of whether the person died of Corona or not. Great gesture by the Neighbours by respecting humanity over religion. Now this may come off as rude and extremely insensitive, but the relatives not coming to lift the bier is just following the lockdown protocol. At this stage of the pandemic, you don’t want more people to contract COVID-19 or worse succumb to it. Countries have started to ban funerals , don’t know if India is one of them, but I highly think that they should be banned here in India too. Don’t know the solution to this sensitive issue but cremation of the dead (preferably as per their religious beliefs) should be added in the essential services (it probably is part of it) but WITH the facility of taking away the body from the house/hospital, so that it avoids crowds like these at a funeral. The traditions like ‘kandhaa dena’ bring a lot of risk of people coming into groups and should be banned. The tradition that the cremation service could follow is cremating them as per their religious beliefs with least possible or perhaps even no family members. I know this sounds very very insensitive but I think looking at the gravity of the situation, such severe protocol implementations are needed. Maybe this service could act as an employment opportunity for some people who aren’t been provided with relief funds amidst this crisis too. If I am not wrong, the bodies of the patients who died to COVID-19 aren’t being returned to the family as well, which again sounds insensitive but is necessary.;Majority of Muslims & 'non-Sanghi' Hindus: *Be kind and just to everyone.. We're in this together.* 

RSS: *Hitler did a stellar job cleaning up the minority mess to keep Germany's 'ethnic purity'. We a leetle beet inspired.*

Aap 'ideology' samajhiye.

Point to me a single Modi supporter / Sanghi, who would display even a hundredth of the humanity (shown by these people) towards a Muslim family if the situations were reversed.

The RSS-infested Hindu majoritarian society of today is a blot on humanity.;Sanghis: ""I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that"";And someone I know thinks its the Muslims that brought COVID-19 because they keep traveling to Arab countries. Can't be more ashamed that I know these people.;Feeling paraud Indian Army Jang me maidan me kade na harte;> Muslim neighbors came, lifted the bier & also chanted ""Ram Naam Satya hai""  

Just curious about this, isn't this islamically haraam? Any muslims here who can talk about this? Thanks.;One more jihad??? Will this religion stop destroying our sacred hindu religion??

This is probably goodness jihad.;these are those brothers of ours who are born on indian soil and very proud of them.;Funerals in this environment are really saddening..I've heard of cases where sons and daughters couldn't come for last rites. 

In Muslims the body requires ritual cleaning and a namaz is prayed with generally a lot of people congregated before the procession..

Now none of this is possible or it is done with minimum people who might not be related to the deceased..

I dunno much about other religions last rites but it's probably terrible that own blood can't come for them..;u/VredditDownloader;I lost hope in humanity and then I see this.;This is beautiful <3;Inter-religious solidarity praxis!

Got soo embarrassed, it hurt hard.;For me, that's a serious gang talk.;The problem with such campaigns is that they tell people to NOT do something. Like ""Don't urinate on streets"", ""Don't litter"" etc.  

The focus should instead be more on having and maintaining enough garbage disposal places. Tell people to ""Use dustbins"" and ""Use Urinals"" and allocate budget on keeping them usable.;Does India even provide education I thought it was just degrees;These hoardings are so effective,people start littering right below it. ;[deleted];Whats the point in anything, while we are at it.

If you do not subscribe to this ideology you will fall by the wayside in pursuit of career greatness.

In the last 2 weeks I've heard variations of this from 2 very high placed Indian executives at an LSE traded firm located in the Middle East. Their career advice can be summed up as below:

(a) your boss is your God. He is ALWAYS right. 
(b) your boss's wife is also your God, albeit of a lesser nature.
(c) if you're worth $100,  ask for $80, and eventually be happy to  settle for $50
(d) if you're been asked to work for 10 hrs a day, work 14 hrs a day, and always come in 15 mins before.
(e) Treat people below you as dispensable assets and see them as sub-human at all times. Keep them in their place. 

Other cultures probably have a different understanding of work-life balance and hence are not prime candidates for wilful modern slavery to the system.

What others are talking about being good and comparing to whiteboard interviews are missing the difference in code and pseudo code (algos).

I love to do pseudo code, architectures, UMLs etc by hand or on whiteboard but writing actual code is pointless IMO.

What you are writing and I was asked to write in my bachelors is shitty programs that do basic stuff and not focus on any algorithmic complexity. More about testing if you remember some syntax or idk what.

Completely hate this and never submitted these kind of assignments and just told my professors how useless it was. I know thats not an option for everyone, but please don’t justify this.

Also, I turn down every follow up job interview when someone asks me syntactical questions, because that immediately means to me they want coding monkeys and not people who can think architecture diagrams or other relevant things. Once you get there, these companies only evaluate your daily work by lines of code or issues closed and not actual problems solved, complexity reduced, etc. 

OP, just power through this and make sure you get a good first job.;You forgot to close the loop with a curly bracket and forgot to add a semicolon after one of the instructions in the loop.

I do it often while trying to write complex pieces of code, because it helps you break it down into simpler abstraction easily.

Let's start a slack channel so we can get up with your progress and discuss this further.

Edit: Holy mother of dragons. Didn't anticipate my comment to blow up like this. If we are all into this, let's get to work. OP let's start a separate thread with a slack link.

Let me know how can I be of help.;Many of you know me from UrbanNazi.com Thanks for sharing it with the community.
One important battle is Twitter. Most of the ministers of our current regime are on it and the IT cell is highly active to change the narrative on Twitter. In an ideal scenario, a social network should not mean a thing, but we're not living in an ideal scenario. Are we?
So I decide to monitor and manipulate Twitter accounts of bots run by IT cell of BJP, three months ago. I did not analyze a thing for the first two months and just collected the data. It took a lot of money and energy. But it was worth it. Now it's time to release it. Will share with you soon.

My AWS Bill: https://i.imgur.com/UaPkOcx.jpg

UPDATE:

Here is the report: http://twitter.urbannazi.com

I don't intend to make money or donation for this thing. So many of you have said you want to donate. If you are sure, then I would suggest the following. I and few of my friends are doing a conference (TED-like) on Islamophobia on 26th Jan, New Delhi. We will bring 6 good speakers for talks and record it and share it on Youtube. If you wish to donate, you can buy a ticket for yourself and family here: http://bitly.com/involved3
This will make me feel that you loved my work and the work continues.;About Rs. 1 for each bot account... How can I help anonymously... Can you make your code distributed, so we can run it on our phones / laptops and computers?;u/onosmosis

I'm assuming that you already know your shit and therefore have already implemented security measures for your own safety, etc but just in case you guys didn't, here is some advise :

1. Create a crypto wallet, and use payoneer to pay for the AWS servers which you've leased/rented/whatever. Using AWS's servers is not ideal at all, and it's always better to create your own network cluster of hosts by distributing a client which routes all traffic over the Onion network. A botnet if you will.
2. Use the onion network to route all of your traffic from the nodes so it doesn't lead back to you guys.
3. Since the data protection bill has been passed, I highly suggest y'all to use a VPN for any further communication as they don't even need a warrant to arrest you in your house if y'all are living domestically here in India. Any communication between you and your peers can be basically treated as a conspiracy. These fucknuts will spin any fucking story to get rid of you or your peers.
4. It violates twitter's TOS and depending on the respective countries you or your team lives in, I highly suggest you check out the cyber security laws over where you're currently residing.;Setup a gofundme and get verified by the mods.

This guy is the latter;Hey OP, I'm extremely glad you're taking the fight to the IT Cell. But I hope you're covering your tracks - AWS billing in India often asks for PAN/GST info so you might be at risk of govt wrath. 

Please use something like Bitcoin to accept further funds. Praying for your success against this digital evil.;I have run similar projects. Recently ran a pattern recognition & deep analysis on Twitter for Bigg Boss related trending keywords. I saw that they popped up every day at a specific time and the results have been discovery of bot accounts created \~2 months ago. They change their names and usernames and each account vanished 3-4 hours after a trend was complete.

I have found similar patterns with hashtags supporting CAA and opposing it as well. Our works are similar maybe DM and we can collaborate on this project, perhaps split bills too, if that helps?

More strength and power to the girl! Her courage is monumental!

 Fuck the system and our institution that supports scoundrels and the people for voting them to power!;There's blood on the hands of not just the MLA and his associates, but also on the police and other backers.

Absolute best case scenario will see this MLA being *mildly* punished. Not a chance any single person outside the already publicised names will be brought to justice.

Btw, does anyone know if there's even a single entity from BJP who's had enough of conscience to comment on this case? ( Let alone condemning it.... They can't even spare empty words)

The Supreme Court struck down Section 377 of IPC. Love wins.,0.9,"Congratulations, India! As a gay American visiting Hyderabad for work, this is an astounding thing to witness.

There are still trials and challenges ahead. Decriminalizing is just the first step--for further rights to be secured by the LGBT community, a more fundamental change in opinions also needs to happen. This happened pretty quickly in the U.S.--in maybe a decade and a half, homosexuality went from being a huge negative to being a normal and accepted part of society, even among the most conservative parts of the country. I do hope the same happens here.

Again, congratulations, my Indian friends! 🇮🇳🏳️‍🌈🇺🇸;Today is 6th Sep, truly 69 indeed. Pun intended!;So I told my colleagues about section 377 and they didn't knew about it.

The government and the law enforcement can no longer interfere in what happens between two consenting adults. Love wins. :);There has been a lot of negative news regarding this country.

Finally!;Good. Now make same sex marriage legal. It is a logical follow up.;Actually we need to call out people when they make homophobic remarks. We got the legal acceptance now and we had our awesome activists to fight this battle for us. Next is the social acceptance and we need each and everyone of us to do our bit l, it could be as little as calling out people and telling them they are homophobic. 

All in all, I am happy for my community. I was in the office when I got to know about the verdict, had to go to the restroom to cry since I was not able to handle my emotions. Thanks SC, you changed a lot of lives today. ;Anyone who opposes the sec377 verdict should go to Pakistan.

Rajeev Chandrashekhar (BJP): #SupremeCourt decriminalises #Homosexuality ! 

SC ruled a year ago (I was petitioner) that #PrivacyIsAFundamentalRight n tdy extended tht right to personal sexual choices for #LGBT community 👍🏻 “I am what I am. So take me as I am” https://twitter.com/rajeev_mp/status/1037662740599500801;The bigger implication is that blowjobs are now legal too. Hallelujah!

Edit: for the downvoters, gay people enjoy blowjobs too you know. This objectively impacts more people. /s;[This comment should be big.](https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1037597682657898496?s=20)

It sets a precedent. Maybe now workplace discrimination and whole lot of other issues can be challenged in court. This opens a pandora box. Even central government could be taken to court maybe.;Next step: legalising same sex marriage...;Firstly, good on the supreme court for squashing a very medievalistic law and choosing to do the right thing. I am genuinely happy for the LGBT community.

Having said that, I seriously doubt this will change much on the ground, realistically. The actual problem is the people's mindset. I mean, in a country where consenting straight couples are morally policed or harassed, I doubt this will actually change how people look at the LGBT community. Now, people will find other ways (probably more dangerous and possibly fatal ways) to deal with members of the LGBT community since the law can't do anything about something they feel is not correct or something that offends them. The problem has always been the people is what I feel.

I am straight and I never had issues with anyone's sexual orientation. Most of the people I know, never had issues with LGBT folks either because we more or less follow a live-and-let-live stream of thought and don't get upset over things that are different from the perspective we hold, but in our country, we are pretty much a minority. I think it's the average Indian family that should try and change their attitude towards this issue (and many other societal issues our country faces). Only then will there be real progress.

Again, I am glad things are changing. I know its a slow process. I am pretty sure that a decade or two ago, even coming out as gay would have been a monumental task and look where we are now. Hopefully, things will get better ahead and the people, in general, will change their mindset and just be a little more open about things.;Deepak Mishra came out in support of decriminalization. I live in opposite world today. ;Now comes the hard part: Getting society to fully accept the LGBT+ community. ;Ah, this is the 377^th comment in this thread :);Next up, marriage equality.

But honestly it's going to take much more than a SC ruling to make gay sex socially acceptable. Heck, sex by itself is still a taboo before marriage.;What a wonderful day! A tad too late, but finally we have it.;I was wondering when this was going to happen."

Source: The Wire.;JDU opposes the move but walks out. So they are supporting indirectly.;Aight!

I got it.

He used 370(3) which gives Prez the power that '370 can cease to exist' provided that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the State referred to in clause 370(2) shall be necessary before the President issues such a notification. ConsAss dissolved in 1957 and for transferred to State Assembly which right now doesn't exist as there is President rule so according to him, that power of consent of State Assembly gets transferred to the houses of Parliament where, again, according to him, he needs a simple majority (not 2/3) to clear it. In the past days we've seen how RS resignations happened and bills were bulldozed through with parties like YSRCP & BJD supporting BJP in RS so it'll sail right through.

Edit: ConsAss dissolved in 1957 as pointed out and not 1954.;Swapan Das Gupta (BJP) asked a relevant question. Whether this will  need a constitutional amendment?

Amit shah noted this and will reply later looks like.;Current number of seats in Rajya Sabha-239(excluding the vacant seats)

&#x200B;

How many votes has the BJP secured till now for repelling article 370

|Party|No of seats |Status |
|:-|:-|:-|
|BJP|78|Supports abolishing of  370|
|AIDMK|11|NDA member |
|SP|11|Declared support for BJP|
|BJD |7|Declared support for BJP |
|Independent and others |6|Will most probably support BJP|
|AAP|3 |Declared support for BJP|
|Shiv Sena|3 |NDA member|
|SAD|3 |NDA member|
|BSP|4|Declared support for BJP|
|Nominated|4|Will most probably support BJP|
|YSR  congress |2|Declared support for BJP|
|RPI(a) congress |1|NDA member |
|AGP|1|NDA member|
|SDF|1|NDA member|
|TDP|2|Declared support for BJP|
|Current Total|137||

To get 2/3 majority in Rajya sabha of 239 members : BJP needs 160 members

If JDU ,who dose  not support the Bill ,walks out of the house , then the lowered strength will be 233.

**The new 2/3 majority mark in house of 233 will be 156.**

Currently , BJP stands at 137* and need 19* more members to support . 

Where can the BJP get these 19* members ?

&#x200B;

|Party|Seats|
|:-|:-|
|RJD|5|
|NPF|1|
|PMK|1|
|LJP|1|
|**Total**|**8**|

BJP still needs 7 members more .

Edit 1: TDP just declared support for BJP.

Edit : NCP has decided to abstain from voting

With NCP 4 members abstaining, new strength of house is 229. 3/3 majority mark is 154 now. BJP has 137 members and needs 17 more votes for 2/3 majority.;Opposition is in a hard place here. Already they are divided.;Okay, so Ladakh is gonna become a UT without any legislators, so that means the Central government will control them directly, (probably by having a governor) 

Jammu and Kashmir, now will become a UT with a legislature, similar to say Pondicherry or Delhi, where the power of the governor will be more powerful than the elected legislators. Also governor will control the police. (Basically this gives the central govt direct control over J&K, since they choose the governor)  

(One lieutenant governor each for Ladakh and J&K)

370 and 35a scrapping would mean:

Central govt had limited power in the subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications in J&K.
(After scrapping central will have full power in regards to these 3 subjects in J&K)

To implement any  constitutional powers in J&K, center needed the state government's concurrence (Now it will not need it)

J&K had a choice of not applying the indian constitution fully since they have their own constitution (Now that it will be scrapped, they will have to follow the Indian constitution completely.

35a defined permanent residents of the state of J&K  which provides privileges to them. But now that it will be scrapped anyone can buy property in J&K, anyone can obtain a job in the J&K govt and anyone can now join colleges run by J&K govt. 

J&K had these special provision which made it have a special status. Now it will not.

Edit: many in replies have said that J&K will have land provisions similar to HP or Uttarakhand, but no in my OPINION i believe the govt will allow people to buy land in J&K (they seem to want to go the way Israel went in West bank, where Israel is making settlements) 
There are VOX videos ill link below (of israeli settlements), that will explain, what i think the govt wants to do

Genuinely curious as to why people are against this leaving aside the heavy handedness involved.;The timing is very crucial in an international sense too.

TLDR : jaishankar had already informed trump administration of the decision to remove article 370.

The members of P5 (usa, China, France, UK, Russia) were also informed in advance about article 370 removal and the reason why it was going to be removed.

The 15 members of un security Council were also informed in advance.;Can anyone ELI5?;One immediate consequence of this whole thing is the J&K police now coming under central control. So expect a bunch of transfers and inquiries and possibly more outsiders into the police force to make it more effective.

The unstated rationale being that some of the local police are somewhat sympathetic to the separatists' cause. True or not, no way for a layman to tell.;Anyone who owns some land in Kashmir is sitting on gains of at least 50% on his/her land holdings.;Satish Chandra Mishra, BSP MP, in Rajya Sabha: Our party gives complete support. We want that the Bill be passed. Our party is not expressing any opposition to Article 370 Bill & the other Bill.

Finally something happened. Holy shit I can't believe this is happening. As a kashmiri who has left the Homeland for a long time and hates going back to it because how cut off and underdeveloped it is due to article 370 blocking progress... this is huge.;A point on bifurcation and why it makes lot of sense. J&K is not just Kashmir. It is an amalgamation of four distinct regions - Kashmir, Jammu, Gilgit and Ladakh. Ladakh makes up bulk of the area, with Kashmir forming the least area among the four. 

Ladakh is sparsely populated and has different requirements than a progressive state needs. For J&K to build roads and railroads in Ladakh is not feasible investment for a young state. Making Ladakh a UT is a smart master stroke. It now comes under the central government investment and you will see lot of infrastructure improvements and other improvements here. Surely this is great for Ladakh.;FYI - Kashmirs didn't have Right to information and Right to Education because theor state legislature didn't pass these acts. 

This is an example of how they aren't able to piggyback on India's progress despite being a part of India.;[TOP SECRET Document - Shah Agenda](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBLx9nfUYAEyn5T.jpg);Can any Kashmiris throw light on this issue?

1. Constitutional amendment not required to abolish 370

2. Kashmir will get full statehood in time and UT status is temporary.

3. Kashmir issue needed political will and the same was provided by Modi.

4. No threat to Kashmiriyat and the Kashmir culture. 

5. Promise to make Kashmir one of India's fastest developing economies in India within 5 years time.;Ladakh to get status of Union Territory without Legislature. Jammu and Kashmir to become a separate Union Territory with an Assembly.;[removed];[removed];[removed];Supporter of BJP or not, you gotta appreciate this. Article 370 had long been an agenda for all past governments. But nobody acted on this issue as either it was too sensitive of a topic to handle or they didn't have the majority support in Parliament. Happy that NDA government has stood up to their poll promise. Jammu and Kashmir finally integrates fully with India and this puts an end to the game of appeasement politics that has been played there since it became a part of India.;[removed];Holy. Fuck.

Oh Acha Bina dimag wale Reddit use nai krte na;The protest for CAB & NRC have different connotations at different areas around India. The fact that it is so scattered and unorganised ( in a national sense) is making the Job of the government to handle it so easy. Opposition is also trying to capitalize on regional distress but mostly at regional levels. Unifying the protest on a national scale and providing a unified agenda would have a bigger impact on challenging the newly ratified amendments. 
I believe it wrong to question ""whether CAB or not?"", because I believe such measures were already there in the ruling partys manifesto.

> [Welcome AJIT, a ‘Made in India’ Microprocessor](
https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-‘made-india’-microprocessor) 

> Prof. Madhav Desai and his team of about nine researchers from IIT Bombay have designed and developed the processor entirely at the institute. The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. 

> AJIT’s features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today’s market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel’s Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What’s more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ₹100 when it is produced en-masse. 

> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.

> “We have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,” says Prof. Desai

> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‘softcore’, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.

While I really commend the AJIT work from IIT Bombay, I feel there are quite a few mis-conceptions in the AMA which need to be addressed. This is in no way critical of AJIT, just that people should be more aware of the information they consume.

>IIT Madras partnered with Bluespec to work in collaboration with them for a major part. Here we have implemented everything from scratch.

Untrue. IIT Madras used the Bluespec language. It's like saying if I used Rust, I worked in collaboration with Mozilla. Now the counter-point given here by OP of AMA is that it is an American company and Ajit is developed in India, so all good. Now let me tell you, developing a language and compiler is hard. That is why Bluespec started at MIT, has one of the few companies that has got it right and with around 10 years of experience in this field, their product is really good for processor dev. Also, Bluespec has DARPA funded programs, which increases the confidence in their language.

Bluespec is happy to give free licenses to educational institutions! Do check them out. Finally, the code we write in Bluespec is owned by the writers, no **partnering with Bluespec**.

>Yes, it is a pipelined processor and thus in-order.

Mate, don't expect to make statements like these if you designed a processor by yourself. Your statement implies, a pipelined processor is always in-order. So are Intel/Amd chips not pipelined, as they are out-of-order. I'll give you the benefit of doubt that you mis-typed that, hope you get across.

>RISC-V is not considered a stable architecture by many people around the world and is not a proven architecture whereas Sparc is an old but proven architecture and hence was a better choice.

I don't know where you get this from mate. Did you know the Pixel 3 from Google has a RISC-V core in it? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7aAUlHoV2E&t=55s)

Or that NVIDIA is going to use RISC-V in their GPU's? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg1lISJfJI0&t=645s)

Or that Western Digital has already committed to replacing all their chips with RISC-V cores, and they have open source cores out there? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlIhU_vovP0)

The only notable company I knew anything about developing Sparc processors was Fujitsu, for supercomputers. Even they moved to ARM -

>We first caught wind of the Post-K supercomputer back in June 2016, when Fujitsu unveiled some of the architectural features of the future machine and confirmed its switch from Sparc64-fx motors to a custom Arm chip.

[Link](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/24/fujitsus-a64fx-arm-chip-waves-the-hpc-banner-high/)

>Shakti was built using proprietary software and this has been built from scratch so technically this is the first one. Yes, it is an SoC. I can't reveal that information here because of NDAs. The compiler already exists for Sparc-v8 and has been provided by GNU org.

So then don't call it India's first indigenous processor. Call it India's first indigenous processor-design language and not India's **first indigenous processor.** Because Shakti with the open-source code-base - [Link](https://bitbucket.org/casl/c-class), an ACM publication - [Paper](https://acc.digital/shakti-an-open-source-processor-ecosystem/) can safely claim to have been designed before you.

Anyways, it doesn't matter if Shakti was even the 10th fucking processor in line after miles, it would just be better if [u/prabot](https://www.reddit.com/u/prabot) stopped making misinformed comments.

I wish there were a way we could know its impact though.

India Today claiming 200+ terrorists killed. But they also say that Pakistan inviting local and foreign journalists to the bomb site to say ""nothing happened"".

Takeaways: 
1 - Even without stealth fighters, it seems Indian jets can easily penetrate Pakistani airspace and return even in a high-alert situation. It's not like they would've been unprepared. Perhaps they flew low or they outran enemy air defense. No reports say SAM missiles were fired. So this is pretty inspiring.

2- As with the Surgical Strikes, it looks like we as civilians can never really know the effects of these strikes, given that all sources are partisan sources and truth is the first casualty of war. 

3- If this succeeds, ie, if we get away with nothing more than Pakistani shelling on the LOC, India can add one more option to its capability the next time there is a terror attack. Air strikes can grow indiscriminate and deadly enough that we create a genuine atmosphere of terror in Pakistan/PoK. Airstrikes could become far more effective and deeper in Pak territory once we add a stealth bomber to the arsenal.

4 - Terror ""launch pads"" is a weird concept and I wonder whether they will simply be moved away from the border for future purposes. I suppose this must have happened after the surgical strikes as well.

;Genuinely curious. India probably knew about these supposed camps before any of these attacks right. Then why do we only attack them when there's a serious transgression. Why not attack them when we find them. I mean they are 'terrorist camps' after all. So Pakistan will either deny their existence at all or support our attack, since they are soooo intolerant of terror.;You guys sound excited , I'm scared. This can escalate to full scale war.;Would love to see before and after satellite pictures. ;For all those wondering:

Su30s are Air Superior Fighters which mean that they can dominate around 200 kilometers around them in all dimensions. They can be used for bombing runs but then that would limit their superiority in terms of having fewer Air to air missiles. For this reason, the SU30 was used to scare the F16s away (they are nowhere near capable of competing against SU30s) and the Mirages can quickly bomb the targets. This is one of the reasons Indian Air Force keeps a variety of aircrafts.

And yet when I go back to kerala I see people whining about caste and complexion.;COVID seems to be a cool thing really;India recently invited public comments on this [Bill](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.economictimes.com/industry/services/advertising/govt-proposes-5-year-jail-rs-50-lakh-fine-for-ads-promoting-fair-skin/amp_articleshow/73993170.cms) which aims to curb the advertisement of fairness products (amongst other hogwash).

What is a fairness cream?;Please give credit to OC [IG]: @brownpaperbagcomics;Only the last part is true, I have never witnessed the other three in real life , and that job part I have seen only in advertisements. A common indian is not so much obsessed with fair or white compared to the bollywood folks . Bollywood tries so hard to put the blame on us for their selection of only fair indian girls and now white girls are given the role of indian girls , female background dancers all replaced by white dancers in both punjabi and bollywood music . This is all to make us girls feel insecure so the business can cash on it , same thing goes for makeup but only the fairness creams are criticized . I am not denying the problem I am just saying that we might not be looking at the cause of the problem .;Oooh how I hated ‘use this cream to get nicer skin!’

Was it to prevents spots? Nope. Was it to reduce puffiness under the eyes? Nope. Was it to stop wrinkles? Oh lord no... it’s to make you lighter. 

The obsession with light skin being beautiful is so hideous. I have relatives you have rejected potential husband/wives because their parents think their skin is too dark. Wtf. 

Utter bullshit.;Indian boomers are so fucking irritating and they have too much ego to understand the actual facts and their ages-old mindset makes me lose my mind.;No brown man will marry a dark brown girl .;Sauce. I want to upvote the original post on ig.;Can you please give me the source of the comic (link) ? I recognise the art style from Brown Paper Bag by Saigo, buy they haven't updated in Webtoons for a while.;This is kinda real. In India and south Korea it's a very big deal, sadly;Love this comic. Op u should post in the comics subreddit.;Heyyy,a brownpaperbag fan;Lol peeps who judge you on color are really immature, like why even bother talk to them dense heads, true beauty lies in the eyes.

End of debate.;Beauty is purely based on bone structure not skin colour;You should use gaumutra or else you won't die quickly.;This thing hits. When I was little and attended a relative's marriage one aunty came to my sister (who was standing beside me and fair) and said ""Thank god, you don't have your brother's skin color"". My sister whose an absolute good sport told her in a nice way to fuck off.

Seriously, this obsession with fair skin is way too much...;I am a white dude married to an asian. She told me about this shit, and I had no idea. That can’t be good for your skin right?;I am from south. While Fair skin color is seen favorable here, it is not that bad.;Brown paper bag is awesome;I have a dark complexion and my schoolmates from 1st to 9th standard never failed to remind me that.;very nice. And also the girl is not ageing at all while aunty ji is practically finished.;I am a Canadian of European descent, living in the multicultural diversity that is Canada. I sometimes eat at an Indian restaurant that with a TV playing Indian Bollywood music and dancing videos, always with a heroine looking longingly at the handsome hero in the dance routine.   I swear, all of the lead female dancers and most of the lead male dancers and lots of the backup dancers look like they are from Italy, not India.  Is Bollywood not able to  get past this obsession with skin color?

A 10 days construction from scratch can only happen in countries where an order of one man moves every gears in the government at all levels. This is dangerous most of the times. In India or in democracies, there are many checks & balances in place to prevent a word of one authority from bringing radical changes. You need clearances from different department. While India may have too many regulations from our ""great"" protectionist era, envying China isn't really the smartest thing to do.;While Indian bureaucracy is indeed tiresome, please don't think of China as an ideal model.

It's all but a dictatorship. If it wants to widen a road, it'll simply widen the road.

Screw adequate rehabilitation of the people who live there, fuck the environmental laws, lax safety standards, borderline slavery like labor conditions, and so on and so forth.

While we need to improve our redtapism, China definitely isn't the standard.

Plus this hospital was not really a proper hospital in the true sense.;They aren't allowed to build a metro shed without the HC being brought in. Do you think they can work magic?

China can do these things because they don't care about the environment or the complaints of locals.;Well they can do it because they have to listen to govt, if the same happened in India following would've been course of event:

&#x200B;

1 Govt allocated a land, people have problem with it being near the town, people along with opposition party go for ""protest"".

&#x200B;

2. Govt allocates a land away from town near farms, farmers have problems with it, farmers along with opposition party go for ""protest"".

&#x200B;

3. Govt allocates a land away from town away from farms ie in jungle area, ""environmentalists"" have problems with it, environmentalists along with opposition party go for ""protest""

&#x200B;

4. Govt allocates land on a remote Island, need bridges for transportation, people along with opposition go on protest since in long run it's a waste of money.

&#x200B;

5. Govt is finally able to find a land where they can build hospital, need workforce for that, tries to build one but fails because engineers weren't trained for such situations. people along with oppostion go for ""protest"".

&#x200B;

6. Govt outsources the process to an experienced foreign comapny/private indian company, opposition accusses of bribery, opposition along with people go for ""protest"".

&#x200B;

7.Govt finally somehow builds hospital now need medical staff, asks all those who were crying ""unemployment"" to work in hospital, many die because those who were crying unemployment were actually unemployable. Instad of working on their skills, they went on ""protests"" and now they don't have skills to handle such critical situations. dead people and opposition goes for ""protest"".

&#x200B;

8. Finally everything is in working condidtions, some leaks suggest that a minister took bribes and is involved in massive corruption. ""ProTEsT"".

&#x200B;

9.People had enough of it and choose the opposition for next election.

&#x200B;

10. Cycle repeats every few years. 

&#x200B;

India is not ready for such things becuase we're busy pullying down each other instead of helping others out. General mentality of people and parties in whole.;There is a 800 meter [flyover](https://nostoryleftbehind.com/india/karnataka/pumpwell-flyover-22-things-to-know-about-the-unending-marvel-of-mangalore/) in Mangalore that took over 10 years to finish.

And we should be happy to pay it;Is that blue smudge hiding a watermark? Lmao;lmao kolkata metro wins this competition of slow construction in a heartbeat;Not to forget Kolkata east west metro .;Kolkata metro too;So many people are trying to politicize this meme. Please keep in mind, this post has been flaired ""Non-political"";It's just political will that delays projects. We completed a bunch of infra projects in record time when needed, when there was political will. I mean honestly, construction processes are defined by companies. DLF builds stuff in Gurgaon at the pace of Chinese companies because they have the deep pockets to get land and quickly sell property. Delhi T3 was build really quick for the constraints it faced, Delhi metro usually takes a fraction of the time metros in other cities take. It's political will.;Laughs in Pumpwell flyover.

Reason? A KM of flyover took about 10 years to be constructed.;Comparatively Kochi metros construction were completed within a decent period, like 4 years or so. I remember during my commute to school there were hoardings with a picture of an Amla (Nellikka) put up by the metro authorities to justify for the jams and delays that might occur. It read 'adyam kaikyum piney madhurikyum' in malayalam which translates to 'first it tastes bitter after that it will be sweet'. Have to say, traveling to the city has now become more easier after the metro came.;Won't last long. Since it's made in China.;Also Kochi metro;All China build in 6 days was a Concerete basement and Portacabins/ prefab structure for around 1000/2000 patients. It cannot be expected to be still for a lifetime.;Guys there's bhopal metro...;Since DMRC has taken over some part of metro construction in Mumbai, the construction is going really well. I would really wish DMRC to take over construction of Bangalore Metro as well. It is abysmal!;Don't think China recognizes private land rights. It's easy to do whatever you want when all the land belongs to you.;China builds a quarantine center building by pushing together many prefabricate building blocks together. 

Equipping hospitals with all the state-of-the-art equipment is not that easy.;i don't know where the PWD departments will appear in this;I remember when Delhi metro was being built. It lasted forever, but Delhi can not work without metro.

Only 13 out of 1000 marriages result in a divorce in India. 
It could be due to arranged marriages, society pressure and the stigma attached to it. Most importantly it is because of the financial dependence. 

Low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages. Failed marriage is not the same as a divorce. Just the absence of divorce doesn’t mean all is well.",Unpopular Opinion: Divorce rate in India is less because most women are not financially independent.,0.94,"Not an unpopular opinion.

Pretty much the truth.;My own parents have a fucked up, unhappy marriage but like many others, my mother is financially dependent on my father, who never leaves an opportunity to remind her of that. He is physically and verbally abusive to her but she still finds ways to justify his behaviour or just completely ignore the reality. I used to think that this is how everyone's parents were like until I met other couples and now, I feel horrible for my childhood of perpetual fear and trauma while my parents fought and screamed, slept in separate bedrooms and took out their frustrations on me while barely tolerating each other for days on end. They still do this shit but I have learnt to cope with this bull-crap. I developed severe trust issues and a tendency to repress my emotional needs, something which makes a lot of people think I am too cold and reserved.  Don't you ever fucking dare to think that your marriage doesn't affect your kid.;Culture and society too. My mom has been in an unhappy marriage with my dad for over a decade now primarily because society will shun me and my brother in the future (and her too) if they split up.

Not blaming her and all, but I think the fact that my parents stayed together in spite of despising each other so much has caused some irreversible trauma to me and how I see relationships.;[deleted];My parents divorced and I realized I hadn’t almost ever seen either of them so much content. Although, various organizations that require identity verifications need a reform for divorce cases. It’s not just the society that isn’t prepared for divorce, but even a lot of organizations, especially governmental. While I was getting my passport, which was after the divorce, I got screwed because as per my CBSCE graduation certificate, my mother used my father’s last name. But as per her own current identity proofs, she used her maiden name. The people at the office had no clue what to do, so they recommended using a proof that had my father’s last name as my mother’s. It doesn’t seem like a big deal, but for people who suffered in a relationship, getting to completely use their original name is a huge victory.;Also considered taboo by our regressive society, their own families would rather see their sisters, daughters in abusive and unhappy marriages instead of ending said relationships because ""log kya kahenge"";Divorce rates in India are low not just due to women lacking financial independence but also lack of parental support and the fear of losing value in the collective eyes of the society which only considers women's value in relation to others (wife/mother/daughter). 

Recently, a woman was killed by her abusive husband after she was sent back by her father despite a previous violent episode. And that's tells you all you need to know about divorce as an option in India.;""Log kya sochenge?""
""Ghar kaise chalega??""
""Bachho ka kya hoga???""

:V;My parents are miserable together, both cant stand each other. They constantly fight for little things. Theres no way in hell they will ever get divorced coz of our culture. Im never gonna get arranged marriage coz of it. Its either love marriage or single for life coz I dont want to go through what my parents went through ever again.;[removed];same goes for my parents, my mom wanted to separate but can't due to this reason only;Yes. I agree with the title and your post and it’s an interesting discussion.  

To add more views or perspective from my side,  
- India has a 6 month cool down period between when a couple files for a divorce & actually gets the divorce. They have to give a final decision after the end of 6 months. This period can be a contributing factor where differences between a couple can be resolved & hence they change their mind about the divorce.  
- In many cases, couples dont officially go through a divorce. The wife would forever go to her parent’s home & never come back to the husband’s place. They’ll still be seperated but their marriage won’t be officially annulled.  
  
edit: formatting;Indian Marriages are just part of a mass breeding program. Its not two people marrying each other but two families marrying each other.;One of my relative got divorced because she later found out that he was a drug addict.
But she had a child with her and now lives with her family. Its a good thing that she was financially independent.
She is still young and beautiful and could easily remarry but society is already looking down on her and remarriage will only label her as a whore.
Arrange marriages should be fucking banned.;Unpopular opinion: Fact;My mother wanted divorce my father and I asked why can't she? She said who is gonna look after me and if she divorced where would she go. She doesn't earn or have capability to get a job to keep me in the school and daily needs. She was bound to live with this miserable even if she wanted to get out of this misery she couldn't. I understand she could get alimony but my father's family were cunning enough not making a marriage certificate after marriage. Also she didn't want me to suffer because of this so she went through all sorrow because she wanted to protect me. I wish my mother had a power of feminism.;Plus, log kya kahenge.

Even for financially dependent and educated women, this is a taboo!!!

&#x200B;

One of my friend's husband died, she was all of 29-30 at that time. She still had to fight the world and people she considered her ""family"" to marry again. She is very happily married now!;10-20 years down the line, I can see the divorce rates climbing steadily.;It's not an opinion. It's a fact and I think it's not unpopular as well.;""Low  divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages'"" out of context this would be such a retarded statement;Not me but my friend's story reflects this fact.

Her parents have an unhappy marriage. When she got a job in a different state, she along with her mother separated and moved out of her father's house and settled where she worked.

When I asked why they didn't get a divorce, her reply was ""Ab kya fayda yeh sab ka, alag toh ho hi gaye. Bas yeh hi thik hai, kyunki divorce mein kitna time lagega."";It could just be that it is a hassle to formally get divorced. Your nation may have an ""official"" rate of 13 per 1000, but in practice it could be that in about 25% of marriages, the partners are estranged from each other and do not live together, but they just haven't bothered conducting a formal separation through a court of law.

It's rather like a cohabiting couple who have biological children together, live under the same roof, hold joint accounts and pay a mortgage together - they may not be officially married, but they will be treated to all intents and purposes as though they are.; I know a working couple who cant stand the sight of each other but arent yet divorced.


Divorce is just a huge hassle, can get very expensive too.;The real unpopular opinion is that Divorce rates in India are less because our culture is rooted around the exploitation of women and even financially independent women are not able to get away from abusive families because of our misogynistic social system;People still have fucked up views on divorced women in India 

But Sati was practiced here so I hope with new generation it changes and women are becoming more empowered at least in some pockets of urban India but rural India is a different story;A bunch of reasons - 

1. Societal stigma in my opinion is the biggest reason till date. And this reflects in how a lot of related institutions behave - school admissions, employer support while going through a divorce, no appropriate channels of marriage counselling etc.
2. Alimony laws are very ill formed
3. An outlook that yells “live for others” - any attempt to seek personal happiness is seen as an act of selfishness. 
4. Financial dependence on spouse (mostly for women) - even educated stay at homes believe that they are doomed if they don’t get financial stability from their husband.
5. The fear of loneliness - chances of divorced people esp women to find a partner after a divorce is so looked down upon and there are literally no non-judgemental ways to do it.;I just think the culture is f'd up. Almost all Indian women who've immigrated to Canada all have some form of abuse story. 

Culture treats women like second class citizens, disposable and used only for procreation and household chores. They're not given any respect.

I've never liked that about Indian people and India in general. It's heartbreaking seeing good people feel like they're not just because of the place they were born in and their gender. 

I say this as the first born kid of an Indian household myself, just the way my own mom gets treated and the stories I hear of other wives.;It's the bitter truth. My mom is happy and financially independent, but the same can't be said about her sisters.;>Most importantly it is because of the financial dependence. 

Even with financial independence, getting divorced is hard. Women rarely get emotional support to get out of a bad marriage and follow through on a divorce. When your own family treats your divorce as a embarrassment rather than a means to protect yourself from harm (or in a non domestic violence situation as an amicable split between rational adults), divorce becomes a impossible pill to swallow. The emotional pressure around preserving your marriage till death do you apart is ridiculous.;And the fact that most of the indian parents would put their children's career and well being first so that he could finally score more marks than sharmaji ka beta. Most divorces have effects on the bringing up of a child. But it would be good  If a woman/man could move away from abusive marriage. So India need independent and educated woman for the sake of this society;My parents have nowhere near as bad of a marriage as some people in this thread, but it's a terrible mess. My dad had a manic episode (he's bipolar) within months of being married to my mom and her dad was this close to getting them divorced. But nahh, her mother said something to the effect of ""it's okay, you can change him for the better"" and basically supported this shit show.

No, just no. Stop romanticizing arranged marriages - that's not how it works. You can't ""change"" a person. Marriage is built on compromise and understanding and *not* on these dumbass Bollywood-esque ideals.

Seeing how shitty of a marriage my parents have - to the point that my mother is basically a shell of who she used to be, all because of my dad's toxic/JustNo family - I'm just completely turned off by the concept of a relationship itself, let alone marriage. 

I sincerely believe that she should divorce him, but since it's not an option, I've been trying to take her with me. My current plan of taking a job outside my city has been put on hold till at least 2020, so that's a shame. But soon... very soon.;>Low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages.

>Just the absence of divorce doesn't mean all is well

So true. People here always seem to take facts and twist them and try to tell them in a way that makes Indians/India look better. And they NEVER seem to doubt their integrity.

Like how it's easy to find people saying, ""India has so many engineers and scientists in other countries, Indians are so smart"" but they fail to mention that India also has a huge population (3 times that of USA) so its natural for India to have more engineers, students face societal pressure to pursue the sciences and many are unhappy, most engineers are also not at par with those in the west. And when someone says that India has so many rape cases, then they are quick to point out that the reason for that is the population.

The Indians online trying to say that India is perfect and the best country in the world and any criticism is completely wrong and biased are ruining the country. The first step to fix a problem is to identify and understand it.;Oh my god, YES!
I remember having this conversation with my mom. According to her, people in love marriages end up getting divorced (she totally supports arranged marriages, pray for me) and she also cited examples of people who had love marriages and then got divorced. 
My father on the other hand, thinks divorce is a 'western' thing. But the only reason that's true is because women there are independent.;That's a big factor. I'll also add that most of the marriages in India happens between people having same belief system (religion, culture, region). I believe it's also a contributor.;I just shared this post in family whatsapp group and I've sturred up a shit storm lol 😂 OP that's really good post👍;My dad has cheated on my mom several times and he is still cheating on her with a lot of other women.My mom is a doctor and is completely financially independent but she is still with him because “long kya kahenge” and also because she said that they are too old now to think of a divorce.
I have heard them scream and shout at each other over the years and now that I’m an adult and living with them,it’s hard being a witness to a “compromised” marriage.
One of the few reasons why I’m absolutely terrified of marriage :(;Oh.. I hate the stigma of divorce. Divorce in not a problem. It is a solution to a problem (the problem being dysfunctional marriage) Low divorce rates doesn't betoken more contented couples, just like low conviction rate doesn't mean low crime rate. A shitload of people are living in unenviable marriages because the stigma associated with divorce and of course, it is nothing to be proud of. But people here are proud of really stupid things( like being proud of biggest democracy in the world!!, I mean what's to be proud of in big-ass population ? Thriving towards most transparent democracy anyone?);A lot of Asian cultures have the mindset of pride before happiness. So a lot of couples just suffer in silence to avoid the embarrassment of divorce.;We need to improve our divorce rate, broken homes and emotionally scarred kids.

No one;Not just financial factor but there are other factors too, many women are financially independent but still they don't go for divorce, moreover there is provision in constitution  by which husband is bound to support his wife even after divorce.Don't forget in rich and poor sections of society women usually works. But it is about social norms and traditions.

And another angle, even men don't go for divorce even though they are economically independent,  not every divorce have to be initiated by women.  so reason of low divorce rate is  BEYOND ECONOMICS.;It's a fact, not an unpopular opinion.;Very much true. I have seen my parents’ relationship for the past decade and I can relate.;Financial independence is a contributing factor. However, I believe social stigma is the primary reason for prolonging unhappy marriages in India. An Indian woman can still leave her abusive husband if it means she'll have to live a more austere life. Unfortunately, the cost of divorce extends way beyond that and a divorcee in contemporary Indian society risks alienation from her own family despite being the victim. You can voluntarily choose to cut down upon your own standard of living and make peace with it, but you can't make peace with the persecution that you will be subjected to for the rest of your life.;Along similar lines,our families stay together not because of love or respect,but because of financial issues.;It's true, my parents are separated because of marital discord and my mom could not divorce as she is not independent and I also have a younger sibling. If she were financially dependent she might have filed for divorce long back.;Pair this fact with India's population , and just imagine the number of ppl stuck in shitty marriages.;>Low divorce rate is an indication of unhappy marriages. Failed marriage is not the same as a divorce. Just the absence of divorce doesn’t mean all is well.

My coworker is from Kerela and was arranged to be married to a family's son who lives in the US. That was 20 years ago and she boasts about her country not having divorce and here is so many. All while complaining about her husband and his constant drinking and over the course of their marriage he has been physically abusive with her. When she complained to me again about him, I asked why she didn't leave, and she went on about culture and they don't believe in it, her family will disown her, etc etc. I'm not saying every women is like her but arrange marriages need to stop.

So yeah if a majority of women were in forced marriages and cannot leave as they will literally have no one to turn to, what else can they do but stay?;This is absolutely true. In fact, if you look at the regional variation, divorce rate is higher in the north east and South India, where women are in general more educated, better employed and the composite penalty of a divorce (social, economic, cultural) is less. 

The divorce rate of Mizoram is four times more than Haryana. This doesn't mean that women in Haryana are that much happier with their marriages. It's just that they don't have a viable alternative. 

When a society stops treating women like property and starts treating them like people, divorce rates are bound to increase. And that is a good thing.;Completely agree with this. All this Indian culture, family value and all is total B.S. I had a grandpa, he died 10 years ago. When he was alive, out of his four sons only one (my dad) agreed to take care of him. Others will just ignore him or pretend that it's my father's responsibility anyway (the main point being he was unemployed for a few years and got help from my grandpa, hence he should be the one doing medicals and all). Cut to his funerals, everyone is crying like crazy!! Acting like they have lost someone irreplaceable from their life when earlier the same person was not good enough to even talk for a few minutes. The main point was, my grandpa had a lot of property and everyone wanted their shares. Still, these morons who keep fighting over minuscule details, again and again, have the nerve to tell me that I should remain in touch with our family since it is our culture. That I should respect these misogynistic, casteists fools as they are my elders and will provide guidance in my life. Fuckk off!! I have google for that.;While what you said is true, a high divorce rate is not a sign of a good society. Some of the divorce rates in developed countries like USA(more than 50%) is fucked up. That means half the children grow up in broken families. That has a tremendous impact on a child's life.

Edit:Disclaimer: Anyone in abusive relationship(physical or mental) deserve to take divorce. 
(This is for people who are completely missing my point that higher divorce rate doesn't mean a progressive healthy society.)"

But this is not enough, this should be a key topic in UNSC. We got to increase pressure. Also, his this tweet should get exposure in indian media too, atleast NDTV, The wire and the Print.;I'm happy Bernie said this, but I hope he doesn't believe he thinks America has any right to intervene in India in any way. Or anywhere in the world for the matter.;Watch all the NRIs shit on Bernie for this, saying that he should stick to American politics... And then continue to comment on American politics;This is why we need Bernie in the white house. He could stick one to this fascist as the official POTUS. Since Modi likes western validation so much lets see what he does then;US must condemn it and so should many rich muslim countries but of course when it comes down to money who cares about innocent life.;Thank you Bernie. It may not be much because bhakts are  parenting fails born of bad parents who failed to teach them to be honest or honorable. 

You can see it from the fake news (e. g. 21 of the victims are Hindus. FAKE Majority if known victims are Muslim) they are posting gleefully on this thread.

Indians in US are fanatics. Most of them emigrated in the 70s and 80s and they live in enclosed all Indian ghettoes so their mindset is frozen in that era and it gets reinforced over and over.

Good on him.;I am kind of surprised by how people are taking the side of one narrative.

Even on twitter, all I saw people posting shit about each other. No one, no one fucking asked people to not to spread hate. The most shittiest part is, these dumb fuck activists. They talk about peace and shit, and they also were amongst those stupid people spewing hate.

Ram hi hai ekta mai, pragati mai ram hai

Mann se raavan jo nikale, ram uske mann mai hai;The reason why Swades wasn't a financial success despite because one of the best Hindi movies of all time is because it was critical of Indian society. 

In Gowariker's Lagaan, although it criticizes certain practices such as untouchability, the main antagonist of the movie is someone else - the British. However, Swades' main antagonist is our regressive culture. And I don't think the average filmgoer appreciated the lesson being taught.;In the words of Terry Pratchett: 
>There’s no slavery as such, except to tradition, but tradition wields a heavy lash. I mean, maybe democracy isn’t perfect, but at least we don’t let ourselves be outvoted by the dead.;This movie had the right idea on how to be patriotic towards your country. All these new military style movies make me sick!;This film's failure proves that most Indians dont like getting offended.;*Swades

This movie has lot of such gems. There is also a quote from the movie ""Jo kabhi nahi jaati usi ko jaati(caste) kehtey hai"";What really stuck with me when I watched it was not how Indians think about their culture or how much pride we take in it. We use it as a shield to defend our inadequacies when comparing with other developed countries. It’s a form of infertility complex or slut shaming taken to a global scale. “Those countries may be rich and affluent but they don’t have a culture to match ours”. Apart from being a non productive way to think about how we can improve as a country, it also assumes other countries lack culture. As a country we really need to understand we are not special. We have a great cultural history and diversity but so do many other countries.;Bhakt :Mulla ShahRukh, dawood ke chamche you are destroying our kalchar;There was an Honest review of Swades on YouTube which ended with this quote.

""Mohan Bharghava doesn't know how many lives he has changed outside of that film""

So true.;Yes, Hinduism,Islam,Christianity sab chod dete hai. We all should be humans first.;If this movie was released right now SRK would've been branded as anti Hindu and anti national immediately (they still call him that these days but it would've been even worse).;Bhakts would've lost their shit if Swades was released today.;Yup. Think of it this way: 
  
In 500 years what ""custom"" or ""tradition"" would you care about people doing from today?  
  
Personally I can't think of any activity or thing we do today that I would want people 500 year from now to imitate that would have any value or purpose. 
  
Same probably goes for our ancestors. They don't give a crap that we dress up like they do or perform actions they did. If you brought them here in a time ma machine they would be much more interested in New technology and progress.;This panchayath scene is one of the best scenes in Indian movie history.;That scene was so unexpected while my first watch, it hit me like a jolt, we're not the best just because we've rich cultural history and diversity but we've potential to be best, people who are out on the street protesting is exactly that potential, more power to them long live this resistance to Fasists 🇮🇳❤️;One such tradition I hate is that women are forced to wear burka's and it need to be stopped.;This movie was really ahead of its time;Following traditions is one of the most harmful patterns going;Women not allowed to enter a temple during their periods, homosexuality;This comment is applicable to any area of human endeavour.;Can Swades be made and released today?

Respect shouldn't be given based on age but based on actions.;Thank you !!;This movie is still very relevant;Always wondered why the movie wasn't a hit despite bein one of the best.

Equality and Responsibility is & should be on both sides!! Or is this thread also a hypocrite;That's what irks me about female Sanghis who defend Hindutva. Like Bitch you wouldn't even have a voice under the system you are defending.;Well we can also say 'just because a culture is ancient doesn't mean it has to be wrong';Also, this quote is very much political!;This is still SRK's most consequential and impactful movie and also the one in which he has acted the best.

Just shows you what the idea of India and loving India is.;Mann se ravan jo nikale ram uske mann mai hain - the legendary Javed Akhtar;This female Gayatri Joshi, after being so promising, just disappeared somewhere. Saw this picture and remembered, how beautiful she was.;In fact, it’s probably wrong because it’s ancient.;The best dialogue of the movie was ""Apne hi pani me pighal jana barf ka mukaddar hota hai, samjha dena us chhokre ko"".

The situation is grim, there are only 3-4 suppliers of the middle layer of the mask fabric, called Meltblown fabric. The suppliers are selling that fabric at 10 times more than usual rate. Which in turn is increasing the cost of the mask. As a manufacturer this mask should not cost more than 1 rs to make and should be sold in 2 rs at best. 
However i have heard that the Chinese embassy along with Indian Embassy is setting up a fabric production facility in Gujarat, however all the fabric produced there will be sent to China.

It's a good thing.;Won't the increase in price bring in more imported supplies, and encourage manufacturers to produce more of them? I read about manufacturing companies redirecting their machinery to make more masks. They are incentivized by the higher prices, and I'm glad it's happening.;Government has now added masks and sanitizers in Essential Commodities List which means they can fix the MRPs of these product, regulate the production and can curb the hoarding of these commodities by setting up stock holding limit.

I hope this helps in neutralizing the situation right now.;Very touching...but I highly doubt the mentality of today's people who are only about money and nothing else. One good man did his part to appeal to what is probably right.;In my locality they are selling the mask at ₹60 with MRP printed ₹35. That's really unfair;Um, Its suppy-demand though. This favours the more privileged section of people, yes. But are these companies stupid enough to be left with an extra inventory at the end of this? no.;India had 2 months to prepare for this pandemic (Jan and Feb), govt could have asked mask producing industries to ramp up production or at least imported them in for preparedness. 

1.3 bil people without masks are like non insulated electric circuits, one spark is all it takes to blow up the entire thing to ashes.;Medical student here giving my two cents.

People are hoarding up masks and sanitisers and creating an unnecessary fall in supply. The medical community needs it more than the public does; we're at the most risk to get infected (according to WHO). My friends haven't gone to their OT postings in weeks because of the shortage in masks for students anymore (this was a few weeks before the Corona scare started). I've had to fight to get masks for ourselves in wards.

Having a price cap would effectively make it so that the public can hoard them unnecessarily and let them collect dust after the scare is over, which is definitely going to happen. Now I'm not saying that everyone having masks is a bad thing, it isn't, but when there is a shortage of supply, the resources should be allocated accordingly to the most demanding. Either the govt should take up responsibility of manufacturing them (like Kerala has) or cut down taxes on businesses manufacturing them and balancing out the shift in the supply-demand curve. Those seem like viable solutions.;So this is exactly why people want the MRP act in India. There is literally not a better use case than this. 

But it doesn’t work. All putting mrp on goods does is make sure the consumer pays a higher price all the time and an astronomical price in the time of crisis.

This is why we do not need the MRP and allow retailers to price goods as per their costs.;Making profit out of panic & death is called Capitalism.

Is this true??;I don't get it?;The CAA is in itself anti constitutional. I don't know why no one is trying to understand? Bjp is so much obsessed with creating Hindu Rashtra that they don't even care for the constitution. Providing citizenship on the basis of religion is ridiculous and it shows the true face of Bjp.

Legit cow piss drinkers.;The CAA doesn't affect one bit to the citizens of India. The cutoff date for eligibility is December 2014 and the previous government has already prepared a list of refugees who are living in camps. They don't have any documents like Aadhaar, passport and don't find jobs, education for their children. It is basic morality that we give them citizenship and better opportunities.
As far as Muslims of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan who want to leave their country leave because of better quality of life, jobs, education and not because of religious persecution. They can apply for citizenship in India if they wish without any problems legally. They have the option of going to any country be it Islamic countries like Iran, Iraq, etc.

Kisi ke baap ka hindostaan thodi hai"";Alot of people are commenting that why his name and him being a kashmiri is mentioned. Is it not enough to mention that he's an Indian or jawan. This is the question raised everytime we see news like this (even cases where the caste of the victim is mentioned). It's not enough. The reason is until the killing is not done due to ones name/caste, this is important. It paints the picture that 'they' are also with us, fighting for us. 

I wanted others to see what I see. I know you guys who raise these questions might be neutral and only see his nationality or him being a human being, but don't assume that the whole of India does the same. In fact the majority of our people first want to know the name. Why? because names in most cases can identify a person's religion, caste, community, status, etc. 

I do understand the concern that such way of reporting emphasizes the difference. But the differences is there. It's not going to dissapear. I believe we should be teaching people that the difference is there but it doesnt matter. Example is we don't ignore male and female differences (its there) but those differences shouldn't matter in getting equal rights.

Just think, what if the actual culprit was powerful and connected enough that he got away with it by framing some innocents as the culprits? What if the police were in on it and framed these guys due to political pressure? The real culprit will get away with it due to such encounters. This is what we need the courts and the trials for.

But then again the case might have run in court for years and the real culprits, even if guilty, might not have been as severely punished. 
This actually shows the failure of the Indian Judiciary and the how the law simply doesn't provide the appropriate justice. Because the outrage of the public initially for the incident and then the support for this encounter only shows that everyone knows that our law simply doesn't work and thus they believe that the only way to give such monsters(the rapists) the punishment they deserve is doing it out of the courts.

There is just not enough police force to attend every citizen's grievances. Plus those are in police force are paid meagre salaries. So they rely on bribes. Plus the Political pressure from local corporater to MP in every case. The whole system is rotten to core. There is no point in expecting much from police in this banana republic.

Changes: Increase the workforce, reduce the workload. Make police more humane, public friendly. Give them psychology lessons as how to handle the complainant as well as situation. Political pressure needs to ward off. Police must not be tool of politicians.

Please do not get diverted. **PLEASE** keep the protest alive. It’s okay if you are satisfied and happy with what happened today but it did not help our fight at all. Our fight is for a better, educated and secure society & that fight is nowhere near over yet.;Justice loses its character if it becomes revenge;Apparently the ‘wise’ man Sadhguru said , it was justice this time, but should not be repeated. I had to really push back on my spouse and ask her to think on her own and form her opinion independently.  Women do feel pretty intensely and I guess they are the one who are preyed on and bear the brunt of violence.. they might have a different take on it;The cops incompetence is sky high.. Either that , or they blatantly and brazenly took things in their own hands. Non-heroes absolutely in either scenario.


We’ve seen this enacted graphically and convincingly in so many movies.. it’s surreal . The guns in the dead men’s hands .. lack of handcuffs.. them being not well built or physically in good shape at the time ( I’m sure) .. lastly our “sharpshooters” obviously couldn’t aim below the waist given the chaotic situation. Finally a desperate state of mind ( the cops minds) because : the murderers had destroyed all evidence/dna by burning the body - did the cops hopelessness ( at the prospect of a prolonged trial) cause them to shortcut things? 

On another line, I’m guessing they should have got the victim DNA from the perpetrators ( hair or body fluids or blood) ? Then you could tie that dna back . Do Indian trials use such DNA as evidence.?

AFAIK, even a simple robbery earns you a pair of handcuffs.. so there’s definitely a question with these perpetrators being India’s most wanted men ( in custody) . 


And one more thing,I would’ve thought they must be on suicide watch. The Delhi guys were , because they knew a mob was outside the jail baying for blood.

The last thing we need to see is these guys ( who were on the defensive last week) being feted with flowers;Aaye...Dumb dibbo Do you know the legal processor, circumstances, importance of evidence and the number of times accused can reach higher courts and file re appeals?

And aren't you the same guys abusing establishment for crime against women? Do you fucking know the principal of fear?

The media is clearly not truthful on either sides and have been manipulating citizens of both countries for years. 
I just came here to tell you guys that not all Pakistanis hate India and I know not all Indians hate Pakistan. However, we can all agree that both countries have different political differences but we don't hate the people. 
I currently live in the US and I have a lot of Indian friends. We are like family now. It's come to the point that we usually forget that we are from two different countries who hate each other. To us we are all the same. We are all from different religious backgrounds as well but it doesn't matter to us, there is no hatred whatsoever.
We all watch cricket together and recently when India and Pakistan were versing each other we were all having a great time.

No doubt, media should be free to do/say whatever they want, but it's true that nowadays it's more harm than good.
Watching news channels nowadays isn't as good as it used to be. I'm not sure whether a person gains some knowledge or comes to know about new things everytime he/she turn on TV and go for a news channel, but they sure as hell have the potential to manipulate our way of thinking.
They can depress you,  change your views or enrage you.

And like you said, not all Indians hate humans just because of their nationality.. coz that would be stupid. 

Separation through borders doesn't change the fact that we are all humans and there are just good and bad humans, nationality, color or gender doesn't impact a person's behaviour (of course culture differs, but morals don't, it's only up to the person himself/herself).

I wish more people realised that though.

But anyway, I saw Pakistan from her eyes and we have a lot in common. The way we think, stereotyping, jokes etc. are all the same. 

What I feel is that if we can stop embracing religion over country and it's people, we can end this crisis. 

There was a time when I used to procrastinate what if India and Pakistan team plays together in cricket, used to imagine the ambience in the ground ;);I have no issues with individual Pakistani people. What matters to me how an individual person behaviour, personality etc. Not their nationality. After all there are good and bad people in all nationalities.

I think India and Pakistan, both would be better of, if they stopped fighting with each other.  I wish someday the whole India-Pakistan conflict gets resolved. Wars have cost both the counties a huge amount of money.;COD Modern Warfare should be the only place where Indians and Pakistanis should fight.

Chill out;Pakistanis are not the bad people, it's ideas and propaganda combined with religion which makes people from both the side hate each other. 

I don't really see peace in the near future. Only thing that can bring peace to both the nations are climate change. When there is extreme climate change with all the Himalayan glaciers melted with both India and Pakistan facing huge famines and Kashmir turns into a barren land, people would stop fighting. Destruction is the only thing that can bring peace. Until then just be yourself and don't fall for the propaganda.;What you observe is pretty common. All interactions between various people in public setting is usually guided by social desirability. 

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social\_desirability\_bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias);The fault lines we witness today are a legacy of the clash of civilizations going on for hundreds of years and much more subtle than jingoism or religious bigotry. But times are changing fast and future generations will wonder why there was such hatred in our times.;> The media **+ politicians** is clearly not truthful on either sides and have been manipulating citizens of both countries for years. 

I think more than the media, the politicians stand to gain by selling that narrative and they have been doing that. the last Indian PM who made an attempt for peace imo was Atal Bihari Vajpayee. All the others were either not interested, or in it for the optics (Modi). 

Both countries need peace, peace will also ensure both countries prosper. but obviously that is not what most governments want.;Indians and Pakistanis will always get along because of the shared language and culture.

You can't really hate someone who talks like you, dresses like you, eats the same food as you, knows the same cultural references as you.

The biggest thing is language. It is the source of communication and miscommunication. So many ethnic conflicts can essentially be traced to a difference in languages, and, by virtue, a lack of understanding;Hear me out man, people do not care much about religion unless provoked, brainwashed or stimulated with false information.

I have been to many parts of India and seen people do not even think of religious differences in regular life. Trust me. Some backwards parts of India (like UP, Bihar etc.), there is more presence of unease. Even Hindus are divided based on caste.

And if there were no political problems, difference of religious background would not matter at all. Many people I know from different parts of the socio-economic strata- Hindu or Muslim do not feel as much bad about Oman, KSA, UAE etc.

Religion is a non-issue unless invoked by bigoted politicians of vexed interest.

In my opinion the real issue of Pakistan is the dominance of the Military. They will go out of business if there is no conflict with India; they will become almost if not completely, irrelevant in the power politics of Pakistan.

Secularism, even religious secularism is very much needed in Pakistan. People need to look beyond religion.

You need a strong, idealist politician who can make people rally behind him/her. This politician needs to make radical changes. And break the dominance of the Army. End the influence of religious clerics in matters of politics.

These are high dreams. Sounds completely unrealistic right now.

But unrealistic, improbable things have been done before in history.

You need proper, secular education- of science and humanities.

Hard task. May not even be achievable within two generations. But beginning in the right direction is important. Very much.

Blood will flow. People will suffer. But do they know that they want to do these?

Peace to people of Pakistan. May they prosper. May the children of Pakistan grow up to be secular, peace loving, educated human beings.

Peace.;I agree with what you said. I have several friends from Pakistan. I did my schooling abroad, and had several Pakistani childhood friends. 

In real life there is only love and friendship but once you turn ON the TV or log in to social media, it's filled with all the hate and other toxic content. The media is worse than cancer.;I am an Indian in UAE, I work closely with many nationalities, including Pakistanis.   


I  agree with OP's view. That being said, I think OP needs to consider  that religion is at the core of the issue between India and Pakistan,  just like it is everywhere else on our planet.   


Modern media has  been used with devastating efficiency to use, misuse and abuse  information to mould public opinion but when is comes to effective  distortion of reality (past, present and the future) across all  socioeconomic bands of population, religion takes the cake, hands down.   


Due  to properties like centralised & unquestionable authority, hyper  simplified logic & rigid dogma that does not lend itself to any  examination, religion has been used with terrible efficiency since the  dawn of time to motivate populations to kill and maim each other. India  and Pakistan happen to be one such example (of many) where this happened  in the past and continues to happen till this day.  


Now granted, that religiosity may not necessarily lead to religious extremism.   
I'd like you all to note that all religious extremism always traces back to religiosity.  
 

Abusive  politics and media are the symptom of a disease that plagues our  species as a whole, of which we (Indians and Pakistanis) happen to be a  subset.  


If we are to talk about harmony and peace and progress we  must address this giant elephant in the room, for if we decide to  ignore it and walk on eggshells every time the ""R"" word is spoken off,  the resultant peace is all but going to be fragile and temporary.;I was downvoted **heavily** the last time I said this on this sub. I am an Indian Hindu and had a Pakistani boss working in Canada for the longest time. We shared meals, went to the mosque together, coexisted in the same working space and let me tell you- it was one of the best times of my life. I've worked in India for a long, long time and I was treated like shit by my Indian bosses; that is, forget sharing meals, they didn't even let me go home for days in a row, forcing me to work day and night literally. Not saying all Pakistanis are great and all Indians are shit but it's still an eye opener to some extent. When I worked with my Pakistani-Canadian boss, I used to live in a Pakistani community and despite me being the only Indian there, and everyone knowing about it, no Pakistani ever treated me differently, let alone discriminating against me on the basis of my nationality. In fact, my boss gave me the job at the time I needed it the most, even when he didn't need and couldn't afford an employee just because he wanted to help me in my time of distress.

But the Indian nationalists today will have you believe that Pakistanis are the filth of the world and vice versa in the other country. Fact of the matter is- Indians and Pakistanis are no different than Australians or Danish, and only want peace and progress. Who wouldn't? The problem is that our overlords know that they can avoid the required hard work for that dream and still get to be in power perpetually just by widening the rift between us and by keeping us engaged in these petty fights.;Not to sound like Alex Jones, but the MSM really is trash;Ye band kar diya to dhndha kaise chalega inka;Chilling hai boy, koi masla nahi;Well the oldest trick that politicians have to turn attention away from their own country's problem is to make an enemy of another country..;The whole comment section is so wholesome u/rajshreesingh;I made some pretty good friends from Pakistan when I use to play Pokemon competitively on Pokemon Showdown.

And the current thing going between us is more political. And related to people's lives and deaths because of the guns involved. We all know it.;Individual interactions are usually very far removed from a country's geopolitical interaction. Just take this example - those of you who have worked with foreign clients.

Now suddenly the news breaks out that China tried to launched a missile at a passenger plane from Japan which entered its airspace incorrectly due to pilot error. Will you now say ""all Chinese are bad, I won't have dinner with you anymore?"" - you will probably say ""It's just governments doing shit, yes I will voice my concern on issues that go against my principles, but it will not affect my personal relationships with my Chinese friends, because they don't have anything to do with what happens on a geopolitical level.""

At a geopolitical level, right now the relationship between the countries is hostile. Due to the unflinching stupidity and arrogance of both countries, neither country can now afford to back down from its position, as that would be political suicide for whoever is in charge. Both countries will try their best to convince the world that their position is right, and as usual, allies will agree with you while enemies will disagree. There will be bickering for a few months, then world will move on. World has other issues to deal with like Hong Kong and Mr. Trump's impeachment, so they are not all looking at India-Pakistan with blinders, unlike what the media wants us to believe. Unfortunately Kashmiris are caught in the middle, just like they have been for decades now, but hopefully things will be restored to normalcy soon. Meanwhile this should not affect the individual relationships that you have with your friends and colleagues.;I have read that in times of peace, the religious lead.

In times of war, a military man lead.

So to always stay in power, a religious military man must keep the war going.;How can I hate Pakistan? I’m often told to go there by well wishers.;You have touched a good point. It is true that Pakistan and North India are extremely culturally similar , especially the Punjab region in both countries. For this reason, outside the subcontinent, Pakistanis and Indians are far more similar to each to each other than any other place. It is also true that on both sides, we do not hate the people. Heck , half the people on the border of both countries were not even aware of the existence of any kind of border.

But I am afraid there is an elephant in the room that you haven't really addressed. 

The people, and the government of Pakistan subscribe to the 2-nation theory based on religious grounds. This is the stated reason for the creation of Pakistan, and I know that people of the current generation were not those who made this choice. **However, the question still remains, do the people of Pakistan still subscribe to the 2-nation theory as of today?**

If the answer is yes, than the existence of Pakistan is fundamentally at odds with the Indian position. India was created by people who do not subscribe to the 2-nation theory and therefore see the creation and existence of Pakistan as a division of what they see as a single nation. Much like East and West Germany. Due to this, there will always be bitterness about the existence of Pakistan, and the wars and conflicts over Kashmir do not help. Do you see the problem with Kashmir ? Indians in their heart see the creation of Pakistan as a wound! And Kashmir is just the wound now turning into a gangrene.

If the answer is no, than in fact Pakistan and India are in agreement that the 2-nation theory is discredited and reunification is the only logical (even if not practical) option. From this point of view, Kashmir should no longer be an issue. Cross-border terrrorism is no longer an issue and so on. 

Incidently, Germany celebrates its Reunification day today on October 03. The reunification happened because people in East and West Germany never considered themselves to be a diffferent people. They tolerated the separation as an imposition of foreign powers. India also sees the partition as an imposition of the will of a few individuals and the British colonial regime. **Do Pakistani people also see it like that?** 

This is the crux of the matter, Indians often wonder while the Pakistani people despite their (credible) claims of cultural and liguistic brotherhood, never talk of a reunification.

In my opinion, India and Pakistan and Kashmir will eventually resolve when the subcontinent matures to  form an European Union-style governing body  with open borders between India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Kashmir . As in the EU , most of these regions will maintain some autonomy, but common currencies and open borders and the lack of a conflicted Kashmir will make most of the issues between these countries moot. Unfortunately, the subcontinent has not matured to that stage yet.;Completely agree, I have met many Pakistani players in CS:GO & we had great time while playing, some of them still friends, guess the hate is only in the media.;Main issue I think is that bigotry on both sides have caused people to cordon themselves into their own echo-chambers. If only there was more dialogue between us.;I watched your Sama news other day, can feel your pain.;There are only 2 types of people. Good and Bad. It's nice that you don't see people beyond this ideology. But it's sad that World doesn't work that way. I usually greet Pakistanis in a friendly way when I meet them in an online game. It's exciting to talk to them and know about their interests. We are same in more ways than we think.;Angrez gaye aur 'Divide and Rule' sikha gaye. The media has become a propaganda machine. To keep the masses fighting amongst themselves is in the best interests of the ruling class.;Exactly. 
A few weeks back I tried to explain this to my parents that Indian news channels are only showing biased news and not showing what actually is happening in Kashmir. Although Modi is the best PM we can have at present, but it doesn't mean that news is impartial. All the news channels are biased towards Modi. My parents became furious on this and started arguing, and in the end I had to calm them down admitting Modi is an avatar of God.;Personally I feel that Indians don’t hate Pakistanis. We kinda dislike the government and it’s stance towards India I guess 

I don’t think Pakistanis hate Indians either and they also dislike India’s government so yea;In most cases, the rulers are hated. Not the ruled. It just spills over to everyone associated. This is the reason, in a war casualties are kept limited to army personnel or at least tried to in some cases.;You're gonna make me cry now.
It's all butterfly effect in my opinion. One thing let to another. Things have been bad for too long now. If you pick a random adult from pak or India and ask them why do you hate India/pak, I can guarantee they won't be able to give a straight answer. We are second or third generation of people who were directly involved in THE DEED.
In the beginning media was honest because there were very few of them but as the time went on it got compatitive and nowadays they only show what's generally acceptable and what most people want to hear.
In democracy if there are 4 people out of 10 who are truly understands and are willing to fix the problem for the greater good of 10, can't do shit. It has to be the majority. Politicians can't won't solve the problem from both side because it gives them power. It's their wild card to everything. If they solve this thing then people in their country would expect them to fix things like unemployment, poverty.
But this thing will run it course in time. May be after 30-50 years. People wouldn't give a shit about religion when they have way way more bigger problems to worry about.
Like caste system in hindu religion. It was a much much bigger problem in 1950s, it still is, but nowadays once you made a name of yourself in society no one would give a shit what caste you belong to. At least majority won't care in cities. In villages if you are a doctor or generally in a good position people would forget. That shows we're going forward.;This is the reason why more and more people have started to avoid watching such news these days.

Ye bik gyi h media 😂;I know what you are talking about. Although I haven't met many Pakistani's but the few I have, all through online gaming, have been no different to people I have met from any other place. I am not going to credit my profound realization on actually having met someone because, it is not a reason at all. Since I have been influenced so much by the scummy western media, organized gaming communities, and actually listening to the 'treat everyone equally' thing they teach in school. I have learned from a very young age judging someone just because they happened to be born in a specific place to specific people is not only wrong but also pointless. But it seems like this concept, which is so natural to me is kind of lost majority of Indians who surprising come from the same education system as I did and yet we have so many racists.

I do read NYT though daily.

only way for India is to be Technological and Innovation, Economic center of the world.

After the Indian space agency ISRO launched the so called 100 satellites, on the back of the subsidies provided by the Government, the Indian cartoonists went on an overdrive mocking a cartoon published in this newspaper some time back. We agree that launching satellites is still considered an achievement despite it becoming a commonly available technology and for that we congratulate ISRO, a government funded organisation mostly employing upper caste Brahmins form Southern India. The 88 of the hundred satellites were intended for a single project and will be counted as a single satellite in the developed world bringing down the number of satellites launched to less than twenty, it's though a small detail which shall be overlooked in the interest of the billion impoverished souls who rarely get something to celebrate.

In the spirit of cartoons and humor we welcome the criticism but this success is also a warning to the mankind in its endeavor to conquer the outer space. Space has been hitherto reserved to an elite club of western countries and Russia, all of whom have been cautious enough to keep it orderly and clean. However with the frequent invasions of the Space by the emerging Asian powers of China and India, the debris is becoming a huge risk to our planet. There is no central organisation like NATO which controls the space at the moment. However time has come for the western countries to work towards a common goal of keeping the skies clean and not let it reduce into an open defecation designated zone. 

India's ability to launch objects into the space at low cost, while praiseworthy also increases the risk of accidents and collision in the space which might result into debris falling over New York city or even London.

;Hey everyone, a lot of news channels are showing that we launched thrice the no. of Russian mission which is ~37. But they don't show that 37 of the satellites were of normal payload which is around 100 kg, whereas what we launched were nano satellites i.e. payload of about 10 kg. But this still doesn't lower the achievement in any way.;This is gold;I don't understand why we lack a sense of humor . The NYT joke hits us since its true at a certain level  , A farmer representing India with a cow need not be derogatory, also it mocks at the elitism of west and upholds the frugality of Indian space program. 

that said, scientific temper and a sense of humor is necessary .No point in overdoing our achievements.;[removed];At last, something sensible from TOI. 

It's a relief after all those celebrity stories. ;This is gold. :D;Your turn NYT ;Wait, why is Switzerland in this cartoon?;It's the cow's expression that makes it for me. ;At last TOI has delivered something good.;India's like, ""we're bringing the cows with us"".;a fairer response would have been big fat cowboys or big fat bikers knocking on the door not two guys in suits;TOI for all your garbage pop up ads I cursed this is just amazing you deserve a round of applause 👏.;I'm not offended by the original comic in the slightest. But the artist did try to poke fun at India's achievement back then. But it's all in good fun. It's a joke. There is some truth to it and all the comic did was exaggerate. Hyperbole is a common trait of jokes. That's literally how a lot of the jokes work. Nothing wrong with it.

That being said, the response was pretty funny and super witty. Very appropriate. The NYT artist was absolutely BTFO'd. ;On the other hand; it's nice yes; but it's not *that* big of an achievement... ;Came here expecting Baal ki Khal. Wasn't disappointed.;I like it. Nice comeback and great technological achievement!

But why the Swiss flag? We make parts for satellites but not launchers.;What did NYT mean by **ELITE SPACE CLUB** exactly? Did they refer to those countries who have sent men to space? Because there are only 3 such countries (now only 2 with the retirement of the US Space Shuttle) and this matches with the only 2 visible occupants of the club.;kek;He is very good in my opinion. ;Did anybody notice the moustache of the Indian in the NYT and TOI cartoons ?

Parents who sent their daughter for getting raped should also be put behind bars for child trafficking.;>I don't condone senseless violence especially when directed at innocents and I also don't condone a leader whose primary goals are to build wealth, power and feed his own ego. However, I will say that we shouldn't just write-off all his followers. Instead we should look into why he has amassed so many followers and why they feel so attached to him.

>I'm not sure how many of us Sikhs in the West are aware but a huge amount of Dera Sacha Saudas (DSS from now on) followers are low/out caste, down-trodden and mired by poverty. DSS specifically targets these oppressed people and provides them with uplifting hope. This can be seen in Gurmeet Ram Rahim's movies, one of which shows him taking a prostitute who is rejected by society, accepting her as a daughter and helping her get married. He welcomes the transgenders, the homosexuals (who he helps to ""fix"") and former criminals. He gives them hope; ""you can be loved too and be a valued part of society."" His lower-castes and downtrodden followers feel a sense of belonging and feel valued and equal to others. This gives them the precious gift of self-respect and confidence. And who do they have to thank for this new found strength? DSS. So, these followers become fanatically loyal to their uplifter. An attack on him is an attack on them.

>It is well known that what DSS (or any other Radha Soami Beas group, for that matter) teaches and does is to be found in Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Instead of being upset about Gurmeet Ram Rahim imitating the Guru and basically recycling the Guru's philosophy to his own ends we should ask ourselves why have Sikhs failed to reach these people? I will only answer the question with more questions. Why are there separate Gurdwaras for the Shudra and Dalit castes? Why are they looked down upon, rejected and thought of as unfit to share the leadership of the Dharam? Why do Jatts from Sikh families specifically target Dalit girls for sexual assault and rape? I think the answer is obvious to us all.

>Clearly, Sikhs have failed to include the lower caste in their universal brotherhood. Sikhi has become the religion of Jatts, Khatris and mercantile castes. The spread of the religion has stagnated to just these castes specifically their Jatis (sub-castes) of Punjabi origins. These castes have come to believe that Sikhi belongs to them and is only for them. The lower castes are set aside as unworthy. So, instead of being angry at opportunists who step in to fill the vacuum we should look at why we are so compliant in letting the vacuum exist.;yo where de dead ppl at !! (too morbid? ok .. ) 
But, in all seriousness, while india is increasingly connected digitally, the education and skills gap is widening too. We need more jobs for our youth. We need to to pay more attention to the infrastructure in our hinterland. If the only time we look in the interiors and our small towns is when it goes up in flames; and that too, through the lens of an increasingly metro based/obsessed alarmist mainstream media, what do you think that makes us ? hint : it starts with ass .. ""united we stand"" isnt just a blurb, people.. time to walk the talk.;I am pretty sure, it is not just for Babas, this phenomenon happens when most visits a mosque, voting booths, etc;the reason, such people flourish is because upper caste doesn't include others in main rituals and decision making committee.

""The Secular State""
September 5, 1973 

Prabhupada: All over the world, they are expecting something spiritual enlightenment from India. That is a fact. But our government is callous in that respect. Therefore any so-called swami, yogis, come from India, they gather to receive him, to hear something from him. Yes. This is the tendency, that... The real thing is that people expected something... Still they are respectful to India on account of the spiritual enlightenment. That I have studied. Still they go to India to have some spiritual enlightenment. And actually we have got this in India. If anything has to be learned about spiritual, then it is only India. That has been admitted by one Chinese gentleman. He's a learned scholar. His book is recommended in New York University. I forget his name. He has written in his book that ""If you want to learn something religion and spiritual, then you must go to India.""
Ambassador: It must be Lin-yu-tang, no.

Prabhupada: Eh?

Ambassador: Was it Lin-yu-tang?

Prabhupada: I don't know.

Ambassador: Yu-tang. You see he's a very great admirer of (indistinct)

Prabhupada: And that's a fact. But our Indian government is not very serious about it.

Ambassador: No, we have a difficulty, Your Eminence. We have got a problem in India because we have got this multi-religious society. So we have to be careful. But individuals can...

Prabhupada: No...

Ambassador: Because we have got to be... We should not be misunderstood. As a government, we should not take too strong a policy about any particular religion, even though it is the religion of the majority of the people.

Prabhupada: No, no, no. It is the duty of the government... Secular state means neutral to any kind of religion. But it is the duty of government to see that people are religious. Not that ""Because government is secular, let the people go to hell.""

Ambassador: No, that's true.

Prabhupada: Yes. If you are Muslim, and, it is my duty as government to see that you are actually acting as a Muslim. If you are a Hindu, it is the government's duty to see that you are acting as a Hindu. If you are a Christian, it is the government's duty. You cannot give up religion. Dharmena hinah pasubhih samanah. If people become irreligious in the name of secularism, then they are simply animals. So it is the government's duty to see that the citizens are not becoming animals. He may profess a type of religion. That doesn't matter. But he must be religious. That is secular state. Not that secular state means government is callous, ""Let the people become cats and dogs, without religion. Government doesn't care."" That is not good government. What do you think?

Ambassador: I think, Your Eminence, there's a lot in what you say, but, you know, politics is the art of the possible.

Prabhupada: No. No, politics means to see that people are advanced, citizens are advanced, not that they are degraded.

Ambassador: Your Eminence, I agree, but I think the duty of the government primarily is to provide conditions in which gifted people, spiritual people like you, leaders like you, can function. More than that, if the government does, it might probably even corrupt the religious... I don't know. Like an umpire in a game, you know, or something... Provide the conditions, provide the conditions for free speech. Not like Moscow, you know, where it is...

Prabhupada: No. That is... Just like you have got the Commerce Department. Government has got. What is the duty of the Commerce Department? The government must see that the trade enterprise, common share, or industrial enterprise, they are doing nicely, properly. The government issuing license. They have got supervision. They send sometimes, what is called, inspectors? Education. Say, for education. There is educational inspector, school inspector. They go see that the students are properly being educated in that school. Similarly, government should have expert men in the government to see that the Hindus are acting like Hindu, Muslims are acting like Muslim, and Christians are acting like Christian. The government should not be callous about religion. They may be neutral that whatever religion you profess, government has nothing to do. You do nicely. But it is the government's duty to see that you are doing nicely, you are not bluffing. That is government's duty.

Ambassador: Probably, as far as moral conduct is concerned, but more than that, how is it possible, you know? For the inner man in the spiritual mind, each individual can conceive his own philosophy, but the external conduct, the, the, what is called...?

Prabhupada: No, no. External conduct means on religious principle.

Ambassador: This is what I was...

Prabhupada: Yes. Harav abhaktasya kuto... I... You can, you can...

Ambassador: Yes.

Prabhupada: ...understand Sanskrit.

Ambassador: Yes.

Prabhupada: Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah. Yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah [SB 5.18.12]. If one has got faith and devotion to God, God is one... God is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Muslim. God is one. So religion means according to... Not according to... This is the Vedic conclusion.

sa vai pumsam paro dharmo

yato bhaktir adhoksaje

ahaituky apratihata

yayatma suprasidati

 [SB 1.2.6]

One must be religious. Without being religious, he cannot be satisfied. Therefore there is confusion, dissatisfaction all over the world because, because people have become irreligious. If you want to keep... In Calcutta, there was, in the American Consulate Office, I was invited. There, they have got a department: ""Indo-American Cultural Society."" Perhaps you know.

Ambassador: I heard about it.

Prabhupada: I was invited there to speak: ""East and West."" So I explained that so far we are concerned, we have no such thing as east and west. But still, there is difference between east and west that in the Eastern countries, especially in India, even in the remotest part of the village, a cultivator, poor cultivator, he'll understand God consciousness very easily. And so far in the West, I talked with Professor Kotofsky... Perhaps you know.

Ambassador: Yes. In Oriental Institute.

Prabhupada: Yes. He said, ""Swamiji, after this body's finished, everything is finished."" You see? Such a big professor. He...

Ambassador: That is Marxist materialism.

Prabhupada: Eh?

Ambassador: It is Marxist materialism.

Prabhupada: But Marxist materialism, does it mean a congregation of some fools and rascals?

Ambassador: I think so, true.

Prabhupada: Does it mean they like that some congregation of fools and rascals? Such a big professor, he does not know, he cannot understand even that there is life after death. He has to accept another body. As we are accepting different bodies. I was a child. You were a child. Then I became a boy. That is different body. Different consciousness also. A child, three-four years, he talks in a different way. A boy, ten-twelve years, he talks in a different way, and a young man, educated young man, he talks in a different way. So with the change of the body, the consciousness is changing. Is it not?

Ambassador: Yes.

Prabhupada: Children, small children, they're just like animals. The cats and dogs, just they are playing, they're also playing like that. But he, he does not belong to that category because when he'll get..., he'll get another body in which he'll be intelligent. Another body, he'll be highly educated. Another body, he'll be doctorate. The cats and dogs, they'll have to wait to get that body. So with the body, we are changing our consciousness. So different body, different consciousness. Similarly, why not after death a different body, different consciousness? If you make progress. Yes. This is progressive. So that is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: tatha dehantara-praptir dhiras tatra na muhyati [Bg. 2.13].

dehino 'smin yatha dehe

kaumaram yauvanam jara

tatha dehantara-praptir

dhiras tatra na muhyati

 [Bg. 2.13]

So people cannot understand. That means they are not dhira, not even, according to Vedic conc..., not even gentlemen. One who cannot understand this simple theory, that, ""After this body, as I have changed so many bodies, similarly, I shall change this body also."" That's a fact. So dhiras tatra na muhyati. Dhira, one who has got brain, one who can think, he'll not be puzzled. ""Yes, he has... Death means he has changed body."" Any gentle, good brain will understand. But people are so foolish now, they cannot understand. They are not educated even to understand this simple thing. This is the position of the world. Even a big professor like Kotofsky. So this is the position of our present human society.

It's too bad that 5 million KG of trash doesn't even come close to what Mumbai puts out in a day.   India (for that matter, the world) needs to vastly alter its trash protocols.  The onus shouldn't only be on people (heroes) picking up litter, but the companies that produce disposable packaging in the first place.   India also needs a lot more public trash receptacles--most people just litter.;The same thread has two other pieces of information-

I always wonder what would be the best generic way to promote the idea of public cleanliness without offending various egoistic psychologies. ;Now it’s on public and the municipality to maintain.

It's not a privilege to be able to afford basic necessities. Able to afford food, shelter and clothing is essential in life not a privilege. And most of India's middle class are just a crisis away from hitting poverty. A pandemic like coronavirus will most likely drive many of the so called ""privileged "" to loose jobs and hit poverty.;World will stop caring less about Covid, once the rich and powerful are safe.

I hope we as a society can evolve over this period towards a more human centered capitalism, if not socialism altogether.;I hate these kind of stuff.That's not privilege, that's basic necessities. People lack basic necessities in India. People have such a low expectation with their goverment and life that nobody questions the status quo .


We shouldn't be complacent that we are less miserable than others . Human life has value . No one should live in pathetic conditions.;I'm really tired of this blanket ""rich bad"" wave that is going on around the world. It is not a privilege to travel to other countries. A lot of workers travel too. It is not a privilege to have a home , food or water, it's basic necessity. The poor who don't have it are unfortunate and underprivileged. But that doesn't mean everyone else is privileged. 

This mindset completely erases the hard work and pain millions have put and experienced around the world to reach that stage of living.;Blame the 'rich' all you want, but it's just irrational. The virus wasn't spread by the rich. The virus was spread by people traveling for various reasons, including work. The only alternative is to ban international travel. 

Blaming people who were irresponsible after their travel is logical. Being sympathetic about poor people who can not afford quarantine is logical. But blaming on people who traveled without providing a solution is irrational and does not help.

Aah yes we all feel bad. We all try our best to help those who are suffering the most through various ways. But where does blaming take us? This is just a rant. And an irrational rant at that.

Being able to afford social distancing is a privilege in India? Yes of course. If you know the solution to that, share that. Ranting is not helping. (Also, maybe don't vote for politicians who do not have development as their first agenda);EVERYONE'S lifestyle has gone down a level, upper middle class are facing problems faced by lower middle class earlier, lower middle class is facing the problems of the poor, poor salaried are facing the problems of poor daily wagers, etc...;Reading this is a privilege.

People keep looking for the invisible enemy, even when there isn't one. Most of the people who travel internationally do that for *work*. They are mostly just middle class people on business trips trying to work towards their paycheck, hoping to catch an early flight so they can be with their kids earlier. I mean now I'm supposed to feel bad about using hand sanitizer? Fuck you! Why don't you give up your privileges? 

You read this kind of stuff. You upvote, and you feel good about yourself. As if you've contributed something *real* to the problem. Seriously, either people like him need to do something about the poor or stfu with this patronizing attitude. Being able to walk 200 kms is also a privilege when you compare it to someone who lost both his legs. Being able to spend money on self-protection is not a goddamn privilege. It's a right.

I don't know what the solution to this problem is. Maybe if we all try we can help a few poor people. But beyond that, reality looks pretty grim.;Maybe the cultures who practice effective family planning and don’t have an uncontrollably large population shouldn’t be villainized by countries where defecating in major pedestrian thouroughfares is still relatively commonplace. 

It’s not unfair to be critical of a place that doesn’t have a respect for personal space or the basic concepts of globally understood hygiene practices. However, the medical practitioners of India are highly skilled and the populace is smart, as evidenced by the outbreak that was contained effectively in 2018, so I have high hopes for India’s ability to handle this. 

And it’d be disingenuous to pretend like this disease didn’t originate in a place with conditions exactly like the post describes, so to blame the “affluent” (working class in other countries) people who are also suffering is really fucking counterproductive, and ignores the source of the problem. This is just passing the onus of responsibility onto a group that you unintentionally see as more capable, which is self-defeating and wrong, and kinda racist against your own group.;What other option do you suggest if not social distancing.;This is kinda bullshit, ain't it? Classic pseudo-victim crap. 

Disease of the rich? That's hell of a way to describe it! Do you think ""the rich"" went abroad to spread the disease? Did ""the rich"" go about infecting the poor?

No, of course not! It's a virus. The virus doesn't discriminate.

Or are ""the rich"" supposed yo feel guilty about having homes, savings, Internet, etc.?

And by the implied definition of ""the rich"" according to the post - it's pretty much every middle class family and above in India.

Does the lockdown affect the poor more than others? Yes. But that's the only way for us, as a society, to overcome coronavirus.
Remember, ""the rich"" can afford hospitals and health care. The so called real victims can't. 

The stock markets are down. Recession is around the corner. Jobs are uncertain. Supplies are scarce. The virus is rampant. 
Guess we're all fucked. And my bank balance doesn't protect me from jack shit.

And what is a rich guy supposed to do now? Not travel? And what if that rich guy was actually working on... Let's say...

The poor might die from the virus,  but they're definitely going to die from starvation after losing their daily wage for even weeks

The middle class and beyond might die from the virus,  but they won't starve to death within weeks. 

So the middle class and beyond look at this love it must be a full lock down, there's no other choice. Which is reasonable

Burr it's also completely reasonable for a poor family to carry on and work because the virus is just one more thing that could end their life, and even that not definitely.  They don't really have the luxury of caring whether the nation's economy will collapse,  and a whole lot of middle class people will die miserably when those are the realities they face daily, and carry on.;What a load of crap. A large number of infections are from people traveling from work. Labourers returning from the Middle East whose very existence is threatened by this virus. The virus knows no religion, social standing or economic background. Every society has been put in an impossible position of choosing between income for its inhabitants and a pandemic which can bring the society to its knees. The choice has to be to risk income in the short term to prevent a massive number deaths. This may not work but at least we tried. Bachenge to ladhenge.

It makes sense that your risk of catching a global viral infection increase a lot if you are at an airport or in a plane than just being homeless and poor. The coronavirus is not airborne, you need to inhale a sick person's droplet.  

India doesn't come near the Top 10 in total coronavirus cases as of this writing. In fact they're mostly countries with the privilege of being industrialized.;We knew of this since Holi celebrations were cancelled, when over crowded Mumbai had its first cases,  again when Maharashtra was shut down, again when 22 March was shut.
There were signs. If you missed them, you're just blind and into your phone for next privileged distraction.

Migrant workers issue was known (Govt runs MNREGA, census, Aadhaar and has all sorts of info) but looks like no one has solution to manage such huge population across diverse states & regional languages within few days.;People are so privileged to post this. Fuck all, people. 

Not only poor work for daily wages. There are middle class people who are working for daily wages. Did you know that? 

I live in a rented house. And I am a daily wage teacher. I hardly make 20K per month. I am dipping into my savings to survive now. As you know, construction wasn't the first industry to stop, it was tuitions and coaching classes. These poor people are only banned from work for the past one week.

Stage II : then they came for Dalits, I did not speak because I was not a Dalit.

Stage N: There will be no one left to defend me...;And here I am learning German of my volition. Not because Germany has a great language but because they provide good education. 

For general masses, the incentive of learning a new language comes from day to day communication, business or education. 

Hindi provide ability to communicate over vast Indian region. Albeit this region is also the most uneducated region eg: UP, Bihar, MP, and the likes.

English has become necessary for the fact that it is the defacto language for trade and business. And India depends on this trade mainly the service sector. Also, most of the education we receive is in English.

The fact that just to communicate with a bunch of uneducated people, the whole country has to learn that language is just crazy. 

I know 4 languages, one is my mother tounge and other three, I learned because of MY needs, hindi being one. I lived in Chennai for 2-3 months, and I was able to communicate in English. I would have learnt Tamil if I stayed there longer which proves my earlier point.

We can still retain all the different languages across all the communities but it's very important to me that I can communicate with my fellow Indians no matter where I am in the country.;r/IndianArtAndThinking;Honestly, while we may scoff at Hindi being made a national language (bad idea in my opinion), there is a major 'language crisis' to settle. We will have to choose one of the following at some point:

Option 1: Like European Union which has 3 working languages. These are English, French and German. All MEPs, civil servants etc.must all know at least 1 of these three in order to carry out their day to day and everybody learns one of these at school - EU 27 different countries with at least 50 different languages. If they can agree so can we.

Under such a model, India could have 

-Hindi (spoken/understood by >40% of the country), 

-Tamil (spoken by only 8%+, but also close to other south Indian languages and major case of language nationalism so safe to include), 

-1 more south Indian language and 

-North eastern language possibly

-These in addition to English could be 'national working languages'. 

Option 2: make English the official language, everybody learns their local language and English. Only English is promoted and standardised. Difficult, because it would mean a fifth of humanity speaks their official language badly lol - it is not easy for everybody to learn to speak English well. Also, gives foreign language precedence over ALL local languages, this could antagonize and humiliate many.

Option 3: Hindi option : Tamils will go crazy. Many others also won't like it although nobody hates Hindi and 'North Indians' like Tamils do.

Option 4: Hindi + Tamil: Tamils will be fine. Some other regions may have a grouse but not that bad. This would give Tamil it's due respect as a classical language of India.

Option 5: Roll a dice

If it was a cognisible offense and if they could prove that he was the perp in whatever cognisible offense he might've committed, then they would've arrested him. He was clearly dragged out of a private property into a public property and they then proceeded to fuck his shit up.

Four things -

The secret reason for demonetisation and cashless economy

Why big Indian cities are toast

The Banking collapse

Government scam to steal your money and make rich people richer

These four things are three manifestations of the same problem. Let’s see.

Mad price discovery mechanisms in big Indian cities like Noida, Mumbai and Delhi.

To understand what has happened, let’s imagine there is a piece of land somewhere in Noida or Mumbai.



There are two parties willing to buy the land - one is a farmer, the other is a property developer.

As the demand for property in the market is much higher than the demand for food, the property developer is able to pay a higher interest rate to the bank. In other words, the property developer has a probability of making higher profits from the land than the farmer.

Now, one might say there is nothing wrong here. But to see what’s wrong, we need to ask Why is the demand of property so high?

The simple people would say it’s because the population is growing, and land is limited, so the demand for property is high and growing.

But if you dig deep, you realise there are two reasons the demand of property is high in our country. Based on the reason causing the demand, we can divide the demand for property into two - the organic demand and the speculation driven demand.

When people buy house to live in, it’s organic demand. But when people buy houses not to live, but to make money, it’s speculation driven demand.

So the demand for property in big cities of India is not high because people want to live and for that they need houses, the demand for properties is high because people are buying multiple properties to earn money.

Let’s go back to our example - as the demand for property is artificially high, the property developer can make a lot of money from the land. The banks (or other funds) want to earn money as well, so they give loan not to the farmer, but to the property developer.

This ruins the economy in multiple ways - First, it increases the artificial demand for land and property even more, driving the cycle further. Second, it creates supply of things without organic demand. Big buildings are being constructed but the working class of our country can’t afford the houses, specially in big cities. The law of supply-and-demand has been killed due to the speculation driven artificial liquidity injection. Third, it increases the wealth gap by boosting asset prices. Forth, because the banks are more willing to fund speculative investments instead of real economic activity, the employment creation is low in the long run. So you see this gap between GDP Growth and employment in India. Fifth, the Indian banks are dead inside. We will see this in next point.

Indian Banks are toast

Going back to our example - the bank has now given loan to the property developer. Everything looks fine they will say. What can go wrong?

The health of the bank look really nice. They have an asset paying them 6%. And in case the property developer fails, the bank can always take over the property and sell it, recovering all the money. Nothing can go wrong. It’s all safe. Right? NO.

Remember the two types of demand - the organic demand and speculation driven demand.



See the cycle described above. You will see why Indian banks are finished. Everything is fine until it’s not. Suddenly there will be an explosion in the banking system, banks will start failing one after the other.

Remember the high property prices were created by the money injections by the banks (and private funds) themselves. The banks fund the purchase and development of properties.

Indian banks are already in trouble. This cycle has started, it will take some more time to blow up. You wouldn't see this till it’s too late.



That’s why we have unfinished property crisis in big cities, the developers can’t borrow more to finish the development.

What do we learn here - The property prices are not going up because of lack of land or growing population, but due to money being injected into the system by reckless banks.

How careless banks created the job crisis of India - why India can’t create massive scale, permanent good paying jobs for its youth.

Let’s go back to our example. The farmer was unable to get the loan and land not because what he was doing was useless, it was because his industry didn’t had a banking system and speculative investors creating artificial demand.

If he owned the land, he would be producing food for the people living in the area. Not only did the bank’s and investors’ careless practices increased the housing and land prices in the area, it also kicked out the other productive people and entrepreneurs from the locality.

In an ideal case, the bank should be lending to various sectors of the economy. This would increase production of useful goods and services and increase the prosperity of the locality.

But because of the bank’s incentive to earn a lot of money, they give a lot of loan to a few people, in a few cities, in a few industries. This increase wealth inequality.

So the farmer that could have created a good agri business and good productive jobs for a lot of people is now himself working as a real-estate agent.

And what happens when the property bubble goes bust? The people working in the industry will lose jobs. All the workers, labourers, will be out of work.

So the banks are, instead of creating long term productive jobs, funding the creation of temporary jobs in speculative industries, while harming entrepreneurs by increasing the cost of borrowing and running a business.

So you see the GDP is going up, Sensex is up but employment is not.

Why government is pushing for a cashless economy?

Cause the banks are toast. As soon as banking system goes down, everyone will start pulling cash out of the bank, creating what we call a “bank run”.
Bank’s don’t have the cash to pay everyone, cause they give out the cash in loans. They take deposits from you, keep a tiny part of it as reserves and give out the rest as loans.

So if everyone starts pulling out their money from the bank all at once, banks will explode, as they don’t have money.

The solution? Cashless economy !

Did you notice, there is no way for someone to get out of the banking system in a 100% cashless economy.Your money will always be in the banking system. Money can only move from one account to another. You can never pull your money out of the banking system.

Modi is pushing for a cashless economy to keep you trapped in the banking system. The banking system is dead inside and needs your money to survive.

Demonetisation was done to push the money outside the banking system into the system. Demonetisation was done to protect the banks.



Government’s Big Scam - The taxpayer bailout of careless rich people



The Modi government is using your tax money to bail-out the careless banks, private investors and rich big-city home buyers.

It’s a scam. The Indian government is stealing your money, and you are happy because Modi is destroying Pakistan. Only thing these guys are destroying is your money.

Her argument is “I want to help the home buyers”

If these home-buyers earn money, does the common tax payers get that money? No.
So if these people face losses, why should the tax payer take the hit?

Privatised profits and socialised losses. Whenever something terrible happens, this lady is always involved.

Mumbai and Delhi are toast


What you can do -

Stop making rich people rich. Stop watching movies. Stop buying luxurious things. Stop feeding the monster.

Don’t keep your money in small banks.

Buy local things, or things made by small and mid-size companies.

Buy only what’s needed.

Don’t waste your time watching mainstream media. Mainstream media is not journalism, it’s an advertisement driven industry. It’s an industry, it works for money.

Learn fundamental-analysis before investing.

Save good amounts of your money in hard cash, gold and silver.

Read books, educate yourself.

Have the habit of a non-materialistic life. Once this system falls, everyone will have to live simple life.



Don’t be tempted by what you see on TV and Instagram

Edit : Some more arguments that I saw (just pasting them here)

Everyone was so happy, there was people from all religions actually living together and not closed off to each other. This was what my grandfather used to say our home in Kashmir use to be too. People used to call me ""monay"" which means child everywhere and was so friendly. 

Everyone would ask me how to say ""__"" this in my language, they asked how big the mountains where I lived where, a natural inquisitiveness that made me feel really welcome.

The food was phenomenal, and I learned some breathing exercises when I went to a resort that I still use to this day to calm me down. Literally no one was caring too much about politics etc, (there were some protests or something going on too but I just assume its everywhere in India). 

Kerala is still among the top places i visited in the world for what I saw. everyone was malayalee/indian it was no I am a muslim first, I am a hindu first.  I think something about being on the coast gives everyone a relaxed feeling and a secure one that too.

I don't know about your state. But in my state, dustbins are not adequate.

Last night, while I was returning from jogging, I bought a juice (tetra pack). After having it I couldn't find a single dustbin in the 3 km stretch. The road wasn't isolated though. I brought it home but have seen multiple garbage spots (corners in the road).

I think the garbage problem would be solved to a great extent if there're enough dustbins available.;Hats off  to these people. But this will not improve anything in longer term.

If nearby people or Municipal is in habit of throwing garbage in this place, then they will continue to do it.

At this stage Indian government should impose heavy fines on people throwing garbage in public.

I came to know about them through an FB page they created for Gurgaon chapter.. (just some 2-3 friend who started). Most of us didn't know each other but showed up at the spot. We cleaned for about 3 hours. We contributed 100 rs each for getting gloves and some basic equipment. The guys had coordinated with municipality to ensure what we cleaned was collected. Mooh bandh, Kam chalu was the mantra. We had 2 kids in the group too. We were quite icky and dirty by the end, but managed to share a cold drink amongst us. Went back really happy and satisfied!

India is being invaded by garbage and the scale of the problem has been overwhelming our garbage disposal services.

Many amidst us believe it to be our fundamental right to throw whatever we want wherever we want, and resent rules on this subject.

Let's not forget the originals!;I was on my way to a late meeting before the match, and EM Bypass that connects the stadium was jam packed with cars and bikes, with Indian flags all over, Flying high. Some of them wore cricket jerseys as well lol but the passion in my city for football is crazy and as a fan I love it. Imagine playing in a world class stadium with jam packed audience chanting football slogans and appreciating every forward pass you make, It feels like home.;I love the fact that so many people turned up for the game. Sad that we didn't win but absolutely love the support that was shown to the team.;Hey I can see myself!!;My small rant about the situation of football in our country: 

You need development from basic stage, And one of the biggest drawbacks for India is the weather then you have diet issues and no proper scouting and organizational structure. I can share a small story that might interest some of you  

I come from a small town surrounded by many Adivashi colonies, During my schooling I was an active football player and I even played inter divisional football for the South Eastern Railways, That time I used to see some Adivashi folks joining us in training and were of the same age but much stronger core to us ( Credit to their hard work and natural diet ), Some of them used to drive a van or rickshaw for the whole day in that summer heat and then came to practice, We still had a hard time beating them, Heck when after 70 mins we looked drained they ran like arrows Over the time as we grew priorities for them changed , I leaned for most they had to earn in order to even put food on the table. I was privileged enough to be able to play but not to pursue,  education doesn't exactly go well with sports and Indian parents in our country, Our coach tried his best to raise awareness and setup small funds from the local shops but in a small town there's only so much you can do, People like these gets lost in the never ending rat race of survival in our country and talents don't get a platform or a chance to prove themselves or gets exposure to actually do anything, be it in training or development. 

We still do not have mentality to attend or endure whole season of football, Let alone the I League. Community Shield etc. ISL is only for a short period of time and tbf it's doing more wrong than good, but still the initiative is good, as no one else fucking bothers.

I still hope one day indian kids will dream of playing football for our country / clubs abroad and people will get behind their players like they do for cricket now.

Edit: retarded typos.;A sight to see.. I’d pay to watch this ... tired of paying big bucks to watch euro friendlies.;Football is slowly picking up pace in India. With so many young kids attracted to club football in Europe and better focus on training facilities, India will slowly improve its standing.

In the initial seasons, the much talked about West Block Blues held up a banner,that is still held up at major games today. That message is all inclusive and is ever more important now.

My take: Sporting culture is minimal. No places to casually play. Courts, grounds, spaces are accessible for the  rich only.  Developed parks have the infuriating ""Park mein football aur ball sports khelna mana hai"" (football and ball sports not allowed).  I have seen people stopped for playing catch with a tennis ball. ""band karo ye!"" ""park ka satyanaash kar diya hai!"" (stop this. Have spoiled the park)

How has it not translated to something like cricket.;This is kolkata we are talking about the turnout is expected.;I think crickets popularity will be over within 2 decades because the game is too long as well as boring because it is almost entirely dominated by our country now. And sports like football will rise in popularity but i am not sure if sports will ever be as popular as west in our country because we never had a sports culture in the first place and it is introduced at a time when video games are rising in popularity , and second thing is most of these outdoor sports originated in the west where temperature is cold but in the scorching heat of india i dont know how comfortable it is to play these sports thats why i believe sports like kabaddi are better suited for indian environment and might become popular once again someday or some new indoor sport might be created .;JAI HIND;Glad that football is picking up in India, but I feel like instead of organising matches in cricket stadiums building more quality football only stadiums and keeping matches there will really be a huge boost to the game here.;More fan come to see Kerala blasters play;Stop hyping this dumpster team.

I have absolutely no faith for this country or a large portion of our people.;Getting outraged by this is fine, but we're missing the root cause of this. Congress ran a shoddy campaign and refused to work with other parties which led to the huge majority BJP got that led to this. Nobody is holding Congress/the Nehrus to account and we're bound to repeat the same mistake again in upcoming elections and two-term PM Amit Shah is inevitable. The party either needs to be torn down or reformed in a democratic fashion. The current leadership sucks and is holding back good candidates like Shashi Tharoor.;The fact of politics is, religion or majoritarianism are great tools to get power in a democracy and even better tool to destroy it.

We are the only hindu nation and we should present us like one too. Nothing bad in it but what about the people from other religions? And what is common between them and us. HUMANITY. We are humans first. 
Another thing common between us : joblessness and mehangai. Except some, Onion price is now the binding factor. 

We are living in a country. A developing one. Our economy is in a stalemate. Prices of commodities are rising everywhere. Paisa hai nahin itna. Women safety is a joke. Pollution control is joke. We are asking for funding for polio meds. Our 3000 cr monument has earned only 90 cr last year in revenue from visitors. 15L miley nahin abhi tak. Note bandi hui and 100 ppl died. Who gives a damn.

Second thing, which is now has become very popular is that to take a clip from some where without taking its background and use it for its own or organizational benefit.

Can anyone go through it and rebut their points? I think there are too many misconceptions and half-truths floating around, and I'm kinda confused myself. 

The article linked does indulge in some whataboutism, and has some personal opinions in the latter half. It also claims that ethnic violence between Muslim sects cannot be interpreted as religious discrimination and will thus not come under exceptions specified in Article 14 in the constitution. Other than that, I think it does address some concerns floating around, and made me feel that there is considerable misinformation in the general public about the minutiae of the bill.;Damn why India compared himself with Pakistan thier are Country Like USA Canada India just don't deserve to be compare with that country i was watching statistics of prime time news shows abou 75 to 80 % topic on Pakistan and that's shit and then i realized the qoute ""Word Becomes flesh "" Pakistan is an Islamic state and India is goind to be Hindu Desh and then will be totally comparable to Pakistan;Then why aren't the other states of India not supporting to oppose  CAB as it has no good providing Assam. Our culture is being destroyed by the leaders and mind that if we're over you're next.;That clearly means that we are not 'India' or 'Bharat' now. We are 'Hindustan'. Because our current govt.

But that you function as a society without all of that becoming central to your general political sideshow, is someting like a miracle.  A miracle that I don't know how my culture can replicate.;Well seems like an outdated perspective;I feel like the conflation of secularism to pluralism is a reason why we're in this mess.  We convinced people that having separate laws and courts for different religions was practicing secularism when it was actually the exact opposite.  Now instead of people fighting for what they actually want (a separation of church and state), they want to get rid of the entire concept of secularism.  The concept of secularism should invoke an image of a shield and not some flimsy fabric which is how it's constantly described in the media.

Had Congress introduced a uniform civil code we could've avoided this mess.;I need to make plans and move out of this country. The bhakts can stay here and rejoice in the hell they're creating, I want out. Sad because I actually really do love the people here.

Is this the same female?;Modi And BJP bhakts cannot be stopped....

I wrote this

“People of our country should always keep in mind the learnings from Mahatma Gandhi that one should always go with non-violence. Its very shocking to see people burning cars, motorbikes, houses etc.

Out of it more shocking is the reaction from the police. The government is instructing the police so harshly that they are even shooting teenagers and other protesters just to make a fear in the hearts of the people that the government can do anything.

The establishment of Citizen Act is very undemocratic and seems to be a dictator move. And beyond all this violence and protest by the voters, there is no action to call off the law from the government.

A democratic rule is said to be a rule of the people, by the people, for the people. But it seems that the rule is not just for the wellbeing of the citizens but to make divisions. Our Fundamental laws says right to Secularism but now directly or indirectly in the coming future, it is turning out that the law will break.

We as citizens should now be educated enough, not to discriminate on the behalf of religion and should unite and live.”

And some BJP bhakt replied

“I won't downvote you, but there are a few fundamentals you are getting quite wrong, which is why I disagree with you:

1. In civilized societies the state has monopoly on violence. This means violent protestors are immoral, but police force using violence to quell violent protestors is not immoral.

* Exception to this is when police use violence against peaceful protestors. This is widespread in India and very objectionable. This however doesn't discount the validity of police using force legitimately against citizens.

1. Establishment has been very democratic. The Modi government has won sweeping majority, and supreme court has refused to stay CAA. There is nothing undemocratic about this.
2. The law is secular. Give express refugee status for religiously persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries. These countries are anti-secular - They have a state religion of Islamic, which is why Muslims cannot be considered religiously persecuted in these countries.

* Any caveats about these countries persecuting sub-Muslim sects is besides the point. Non-muslims are definitely persecuted there.”

Now he seems to be right in many ways but what i can see is if the law is secular then why the hell the name of muslims did not included....Like if in 1947 the muslims who resided in area which is included in India currently, they should also be given a opportunity to come back to india if Hindus are given.

People are still going to restaurants just because they're open, as if the fact that they're open means they're safe. People are putting way too much trust into food service workers (I mean no offense by this, I've worked in the food service industry). The restaurant may claim to be taking precautions, but in reality, there has got to be a pretty high chance that some employees aren't actually taking those precautions, and the restaurants definitely aren't making sure the precautions are actually happening.

There are definitely some restaurants open who are probably taking the right precautions, but in the end, the employees are just like any other citizen, and we don't know what they're exposed to after work. Unless they are washing their hands every single time they hand out a to-go order, you cannot trust that they're going to stay safe enough to keep the virus at bay.

I just don't let myself trust those workers and I'm refusing to get any takeout because of that. That's what everyone should be doing.

But it was a disaster waiting on wings. Who was our number 4 and 5?

 In australia they use dhoni in crunch situations. At that time rayudu was a fixed player, then all of a sudden we saw vijay shankar, in new zealand series we had kedar jadhav and rayudu and, in world cup, we really had a messed up middle order. Don't act surprised pikachu face, whenever rohit and kohli haven't fired in the last year we have struggled. Goddamnit against Afghanistan we scored a paltry 230 round. If that wasn't a warning, what more could be? If it was pant and pandya whom you were going to back, why didn't you play them all the time before the world cup? 

Lets see Every time india or any other team dominates the world scene..all of them got ""finishers"" and a strong middle order .. who's the finisher here? It was bevan for australia, it was yuvraj for india, it was dhoni for india, it was abd for south africa. In today's england you see butler and stokes..etc etc. Australia gave carey the time and see what a player he has become. 

And had it not been for jadeja where would we have been reeling? 

Today all of a sudden you send DK at 5, and what's his net experience in this world cup? Some 15 20 deliveries.

India of late is over dependent on 2 - 3 players in batting. This isnt good, and the effects of it will be well felt by next world cup if remedial measures are not taken. Lets see where teams that were over dependent on a few players are today. Sri Lanka. (Sanga, jayawardane, dilshan). South africa (amla, abd, duplessis). Its high time we fix this

Consider this a rant. Forgive me for venting my frustration;First of all, Hats off to **Jaddu and Dhoni !** If not for them, the match would have ended long back

Secondly, no one can blame Dhoni. Yes, he missed today. But blame the top order who fell for single digits in a WC semi final. 

Thirdly, the sheer number of people lashing out on Dhoni speaks volumes on the hope and expectation people have on Dhoni. Remember for a billion people, match was not over irrespective of whether 3 or even 6 wickets were down. So, as long as Dhoni stood he carried the hopes of a **billion people**.

Also Dhoni needs to unretire from tests.;Jadeja's wicket was the turning point.;TBH the openers destroyed the whole fucking game by acting too overconfident.;One of the openers and Kohli had always played till 30th over and our middle order was never tested in the group stage. Our middle order never had to chase a difficult total. They just had to maintain the solid run rate which Rohit and Kohli had provided them with. Today was the real test. We couldn't hold onto the wickets. Willaimson and Taylor's innings look really great today. They played with grim.

He is my Captain Cool. He changed the cricket status in India.

Thanks for all the memories legend.

Miss you G.O.A.T.;How often we see matches like this. From 4 wickets down, we pulled it back. What a brave fight put up by 'bits and pieces"" sir Jadeja and Dhoni. Dhoni didn't fire up early and gave chances  to Jadeja while holding one end. If we had lost Dhoni earlier match would have ended there. Dhoni holding one end also gave Jadeja cushion to fire up in between. Dhoni's runout was unfortunate otherwise Jimmy Nisham would have seen couple of balls sailing over the ropes in 50th over.

We saw how our tail collapsed after Dhoni's wicket and must be the reason why Dhoni preferred to play a slow knock than losing a wicket in group stages. 

P. S.: I am not a Dhoni supporter but sometimes we need to put our brain in line and stop complaining.;Well played India ♿♿♿♿;India played fantastic, and there is nothing to complain about, honestly. The opening spell by NZ bowlers was way too good and no one could have withstood it, specially with the pitch being what it was after the rains.

India did VERY well to claw their way back into the match, first with Pant and Pandya, then with Jadeja and Dhoni. The only thing we can fault is that three of those batsmen got out to lofted shots. But even on that, they would have had to resort to some big hitting at some point anyway, it was bad luck they got out when they tried it, if it had come off it would have been hailed as 'timely.'

&#x200B;

You can't expect Sharma and Kohli to fire on EVERY match. It was good that India showed they have the depth to deliver even when the top three get out cheaply, which rarely happens. 

&#x200B;

In a close low-scoring match with the pitch helping the bowlers, it is always anyone's game, it was just not India's day. Don't go around blaming individuals or selection, it is ridiculous.;I thought I had finally gotten over it. And now this shows up in my feed.  Made me cry again.  😭😭;Still can't believe we are out of the world cup. We had bowled so good in the semi final and everyone was expecting us to win.;Every inch matters! :-P;Insah Allah! Boys played well!;I don't know about that. I thought that run out saved Dhoni's ass because it came after a six.   


Dhoni sure as shit wasn't about to win it like the old days.  


He would have tried but the soggy outfield would have made it more difficult than usual. In the end, he would have been left standing with 3 wickets in hand and a WC exit.  


People would have blamed only him.;Heartbreak.;NZ kick us out of contention yet again. Damn was painful to watch.;Most heartbreaking moment for me;The sadest pictures of the year;If openers had somehow held on to their wickets..;I heads there were 6 people out of the line in fielding today and broke the law. Bad umpiring.
[Here's a few things the proof](http://imgur.com/gallery/lNzQEjJ)

u/iknowamitshah;So many match winners in the team ( Kohli, Sharma, Dhoni, Pant, Pandya) had a bad day on the same day!;One inch is what makes all the difference!;Dead game. Wish India was more passionate about other talents in this massive country.;I don't even watch cricket outside of wc and was crestfallen.

Good on Jadeja though wonder why doesn't play more often.;I saw lot of arrogant bhakths in our team including the captain, I wish this match makes these arrogant assholes eat humble pie.;How much will you cry there are different sports also do you count seconds and inches there?;Watching cricket in 2019;Kohli fucking choked again in lockouts. Averages 12.;Hi i'm from r/all ... so what exactly is happening here?
Genuine question because i don't know the game;KL Rahul and the extraordinarily inexplicable support he has despite repeated failures especially in crunch situations was the main cause of India losing the test series in England, South Africa, and this semi final. 
Oh, and Karthik was the worst selection of all time and they should have seen this coming with Pant the way he let Delhi down time and again in run chases. Pandya is ultimately somewhat overrated, the real bits and pieces guy, not good enough in either bowling or batting."

I started this piece about a year ago and have been working on it on and off. It is of the Golden Temple in Punjab, India.  I was inspired by many yearly trips there. It's one of the most magical places I've seen, a floating temple in a way. 

One of the outstanding traits of sikhism is the sense of service, and at this temple, they feed like 100,000 people a day.  The kitchen is running all day every day. People travel there as a sort of pilgrimage and even sleep on the sides.  I met a man from france last time, he had left a difficult situation with his family and was sitting by the water drawing. 

Happy thursday guys;Ek hi to dil hai kitni baar jeetoge?;wow , just beautiful , you are very talented .;I've been to Golden Temple once and the place gave me inner peace i found nowhere again.

What they advertise is above and what they delivered to me today is below.,0.98,"/r/ExpectationVsReality;These places suck because you don't get the value you pay for. 

And, that's marketing. No fast food item meets the marketed picture. That sucks

So, what I've done is that I've put all these MN fast food chains in my black listed food places. 

From the local restaurants and food joints, I can get three times or at least two times of the quantity and much better taste than what I get from these black listed places. 

I once spent 900 (for 2) in one of these food chains and I didn't even feel full. Another day, I Went to a restaurant and ate enough starters for 600 (for 2) and the food tasted way better. Same goes with McD, Domino's, Burger King.

A food festival was going on opposite to the Gandhi statue and we decided to check that out. There were lots of stalls selling rare foods. It was colorful and enticing. But one grill shop caught my attention. The guy was working the grill with so much precision. He looked like some kind of celebrity chef. He was working the beef and some of his associates we're working the chicken. I glanced at the menu and asked if he had the hamburger. He said yes and started to grill a little piece of meat and a couple of buns. He didn't add any veggies. Just the meat, a sauce and the buns. It was just the size of my palm. It was 80 rupees. I tell you man, that was the best burger I've ever had in my life. The buns were as soft as a baby's ass and the meat was tender and juicy. That was the last burger he made that day. My friend and I had to split it. I've never had a burger since. The ones in McD, KFC or the Burger King doesn't do it for me anymore. I still dream about the first bite I took in that burger.;Dude give them credit for putting those big ass slices of onions right there.

I have invoked the soldier. Argument over. 

;I work in an E.R in Southern California and I’ve found the way they work to be really weird. 

If you arrive by ambulance, A doctor will see you initially to make sure you’re stable. After you’ve been registered (my job) we check to see which doctors are covered by your insurance. That will decide what surgeons/specialists/hospitalists you will have access to. 

Sometimes you won’t be covered at our hospital at all and I will call an ambulance to take you to a hospital that will take your insurance. 

You will always receive emergency treatment at any hospital, but as soon as you’re deemed stable your level of care is determined by your insurance.

I always felt like mere aalawa wo last benchers tak maal fook ke do chaar questions kar jate the lekin mere bheje me kbhi ghusa nhi. Idk kaise maine engineering maths ke teen parts nikal bhi liye.;Either India is a linear function of x or it is a constant. If it a constant then LHS is India(NRC-CAA) and RHS is zero, and this holds true only if NRC = CAA, at which point the act of integration is moot. 


Now let's establish the relationship between NRC and CAA for this equation to hold true. Let the linear function be mx. Its differentiation is m. 

LHS would work out to 0.5mx^2 evaluated at NRC and CAA and subtracted. 

So 0.5m[ NRC^2 - CAA^2 ] = m

NRC^2 - CAA^2 = 2;

Which suggests that |NRC| > |CAA|. In absolute terms, NRC is a bigger than CAA.

This equation looked dumb in the beginning but turned out to be much deeper.;This guy maths;So I have heard this several times that CAA is unconstitutional.

Only people who went to ""real"" school can understand this.;The LHS should be modified to have ""Bhakts"" instead of ""India"" because the LHS currently actually means - Integration of India from CAA to NRC.

But i hope i dont.;A driver cancelling the ride drops the driver’s rating and generally high rated drivers are the ones who have nice and clean car with good AC, are polite plus who do not cancel.

My home is where the drivers are likely to cancel, so on my daily commute I most of the time end up in a good car (sometimes after a couple of cancelled rides) because only highly rated drivers would not cancel.

We can predict based on the driver’s rating if he/she is going to cancel or not. If the rating is 4.8+, the driver will come. If it is 4.5-, they likely won’t.;Given the political atmosphere I spent two minutes straight trying to decode the CAB/NRC joke in here.;[deleted];It might be frustrating, but think from their perspective, it's their job, don't you think they should have atleast the luxury to choose where they want to go ?. Sometimes they select home route and a ride is provided to them which deviates 4-5 km from their route, and they are in hurry to reach their home, shouldn't you think they have right to decline. 
I think here these cab brokers needs to stand up and adress the issue by understanding why they cancel rather than penalizing them.;Guys, it is a sincere request to you all. Please refrain from using scientific terms in memes (or whatever) if you don't understand what exactly they mean just for the sake of appearing cool. Most probably you will end up using it incorrectly as is the case here. 
 
Here, the cab driver exactly knows if he (or she for that matter) will accept the journey which entirely depends upon your destination. Hence the result is deterministic and not probabilistic for one observer. But in the Schrodinger's cat experiment, there is absolutely no way to be deterministic for any observer whatsoever. The cat is then considered to be in superposition of the states dead and alive. And hence the results there are probabilistic. Hence the Schrodinger's cat analogy is used wrongfully here."

What an amazing movie that was.;Seriously, Chatur killed it. The guy was merciless, cruel and cold blooded genius. Sneaking playboy magazines into dorm rooms before the exam? Damn! Talk about the Art of War. 
;I mean he was living a sweet life, he was clearly a multimillionaire, Phunsuck Wangdu did really well but Chatur did quite well for someone who should be just around 31-32 too. Probably through a ton of hardwork. TBH his methods did take him far. Phunsuck was a natural genius. Who are we kidding? Most of us would kill for a life like Chatur, he is just 32 (since it's been 10 years), for all we care, he could retire with his hot wife and huge mansion and live a sweet life through interests on investments and follow whatever passion he has. Most of us can't be Phunsuck, we can't be absolute geniuses and at least for me, I don't have any crazy passion that would pay me too. So I'd rather become a corporate sellout for a few years and then have enough money to venture into anything I feel like. 

Edit: it's a personal opinion guys, please stop bombarding me with obvious fallacies in my argument.

Yes, there is a problem in India: following one's dream is difficult. But how many people you know actually have serious enough dreams AND are exceptional enough to succeed at one thing? In my conversations, the very people who liked the message of the movie and missed not putting it to practice in their own lives failed to name a single thing they \*were\* exceptional at.

The problems that Rancho brings to the front are problems affecting  fewer than perhaps 1% of the school/college-going population. His (overconfident), high-risk methods of dealing with things might work for the next Sachin Tendulkar in present-day Shivaji Park, but are useless, even misleading, to someone who is in the ballpark of average. For the vast majority of us, it would be utterly stupid to use Rancho's advice.   It would be way more rewarding, on average, to be like Chatur, but that character is written to be a laughing stock.

The movie could have posited that Rancho and Chatur are adversaries who are both correct in their own place. Which of the two you favour as a viewer comes down to your own assessment of self-worth. That narrative would have been much more truthful, responsible and not quite 'holier than thou'.;Chatur got visited by the Fab Five and had a glow-up;Stupid"

We certainly don't have control over the rains but we can certainly prepare for it, so that when it rains we are ready to preserve as much water as we can.

Building more reservoirs, catchments, etc can be employed to maintain a minimum availability of water. But along with this people must be constantly warned and educated about responsible water consumption and more water treatment plants should be setup so that more and more water can be reused.

Congratulations! You girls are the real deal.;The fact that some of us didn't even know we had a rugby team shows how unsupportive India is in sports except for cricket.

Growing up in a semi rural town, rugby and cricket were the most popular sports by far. Love this!

But most of the comments are same because all we care about cricket and 2 3 other major games and such games are very underrated even govt does not gives shit about any other games besides 3-4 games.

xarteztx,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001DD2A16D108>,7xqpyb,Non-Political,2942,,Hi r/India! I wanted to share this piece I finished this morning of my granduncle in Punjab,0.96,"""Beyond every bend""
oil on canvas
36""x36""

This is painting of my granduncle who I visit almost every year in India. He has always been a very cheerful and jolly man, almost like my own santa growing up.  During my recent visit in 2016, he was not the same.  He would often come around the village with his grandchildren around his shoulders. This time I would go to visit him, in a small room on the side of the road. The room was connected to the larger family house but there was a sense of isolation and exclusion there. 

I think he was alone, away from his family. He had lost about 50 lbs and was not able to communicate any sort of happy expression. He sat up when he saw me but deep down, there was an underlying loneliness I could relate to. It was almost like he was just waiting for the end.

I can relate to that deep sense of not belonging and often try to communicate it through some of my portraiture. It is in many ways baffling to me how we can be moving inward together, at the same time, not knowing we are not going through it alone.  Unfortunately, I feel at times my culture has been a factor in that. Things are often unsaid and misunderstood. I've grown up not knowing how to express internal conflict and struggle because it just wasn't something practiced at the family table. Eventually I would like to create enough work for exhibits and to bring some light to issues of mental health to the general public but also to my own culture.   

The goal of the painting was to portray the overall mood so I started the painting with a large brush to cover the initial layer. 99% of the painting after that was in palette knife. The knife allows me to create movement, texture, and atmosphere in a few sessions instead of having to layer with a brush.;I don't know why but this reminds me so much of [this image](http://www.culturalindia.net/iliimages/Bhagat-Singh-ili-24-img-5.jpg) of Bhagat Singh;Always loved the Punjabi getup and persona, your granduncle and your painting really personified both! Good going! ;Great portrait, OP. Please post this in r/art. They will love it.;Man,that's awesome 

Can really sense the sadness(lonliness?) radiating from the painting;I can sense the sadness. Unfortunately, humility, empathy, and sympathy is fading away by each day. People care about others more than their own immediate families. As they say, Charity begins at home, but it is rarely practiced.

May Waheguru bless him, as well as you who is showing a deep empathy. We need people like you in our families.;Looks like my grandfather 😔😭😣
Beautiful painting ;It's beautiful. No words.;wow. if its ok with you, may i buy this? 
;Bapu Ji;Frame it..;Do you paint professionally?? Do you have a website or something? Do people commission you to do paintings ? Will you be willing ? Sorry for the many questions 
Wonderful painting ;Needs more shadow ..Like under the charpai and his feet. He looks like he is floating somewhere on a magic carpet. I think you should keep working on it some more. The piece looks like it's missing something .. like the background and where he is. It's wide enough to not be a portrait so looks a bit empty. I feel the desire to see more of who he is, get a sense of him perhaps with objects around him. Mise en scene ma nigga, mise en scene.;Oh hey man! Good to see you back again :)

;It is a nice drawing.;Your colors are like a dream bro.

Something most of our countrymen don’t understand. The salary of employees, expenses , especially for a newspaper requires a lot of funds and they depend on advertisements to cover these up. Most of the newspapers are already running under losses due to news availability online or WhatsApp university. A newspaper costs actually ₹35- ₹50 but we are charged ₹2 - ₹7 only because of this advertisement. The other better alternative is crowd funding or public funding like that of “The Wire” or other online news outlet which funds itself from patreon or other akin services. This eliminates bias and gives scope for rational journalism. Personally, I advocate such crowd funding especially now when most media is bought and run by political parties masquerading as businessmen.

The four sided square represents the four faced God bramha. Vishnu is the creator of Bramha and is represented as a square atop a square which is an octagon (he also possesses ashta mangala symbols). Shiva has infinite/no attributes (as you want him to be) and thus is circular. 
Nearly every pillar and Shiva linga in temples (especially in South India) have these three parts.

Power move!;""make it mandatory for all religious trusts, irrespective of which  religion they follow, to donate 80% of God’s wealth’ to the PM CARES  fund so that the money could be used for the people who need it during  this Covid-19 lockdown""

certainly a good idea and the best use of money probably, but religious trusts can raise a legal objection.;I think many temples have come forward and are already donating money. Shirdi recently donated 51 crores.

https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/coronavirus/news/shirdi-saibaba-kolhapur-temples-donate-to-cms-relief-fund-for-coronavirus-measures/articleshow/74849966.cms;Hindu temples are already under Government control with a large chunk of donations being utilised by state governments for their schemes. Moreover, if a temple doesn't spend 85 % of their total income in a year(not sure if it's income after expenses), then they pay an income tax too. Which honestly I have no problem with but it's also a fact that none of the other religions has the same kind of government oversight or control. Government should have an uniform way of dealing with all the religions and bring them under control. If they can treat religion as a business, religion should be taxed and regulated as a business.;Dangey karwayega kya chorey!;Mere 15 lakh please dedo modi ji.;I heard that many of the trusts managing various temples have already donated huge amounts.

Isckon, Delhi recently announced providing food to the needy in Delhi. Everyone is doing their bit.

Clearly, all of these are just PR stunts in India. If media stops covering them, many of them will suddenly disappear.;How about 80% of them party funds too?;Typical attention seeker whom everyone will ignore after his 15 minutes of fame.;>15 year old

I stopped reading there;Why can't the political parties also start donating.....;This is a stupid suggestion. Fight COVID 19 as in what? Won't the government receive the money? You can assume most of the 80% would be taken as bribes and only a fraction of it would be given to hospitals.

Plus its not like COVID 19 is the only thing killing Indians right now. If you took 80% of money from a gurdwara, they might be unable to serve free food to many people. If you took 80% of money from temples, they might have to add entry fees to the temple to just sustain the cost.;How about 80% of funds of all sporting bodies?;He should have asked for not more than 20-30% which is more doable for these trusts. Even if this message gets viral and reaches to organisations, they can easily deny this request and call it a joke by making excuse that it's huge amount of money.
And believe me, just 20% of what they have would be enough to fight Corona.;Like god@sbi 😄;Money is fine , but do even have enough doctors and Goods to buy all these ?   
or will it got in Advertisement of BJP ?;I have seen volunteers from NGOs and religious institutions distributing food packets, daily, to the homeless and the poor outside. So whatever he is asking for is already achieved. 

My point: Religious institutions don't have 80 percent of their wealth in liquid cash. They are in the form of trusts and other institutions like educational institutions, messes that serve free food, vehicles and equipment that their volunteers use. Asking them to work with government in collaboration makes sense. But donating assets in a lockdown? How is that going to help anyone?

 It's not ""God's wealth"", it's the religious organization's wealth and he wants our PM to force it out of them? Doesn't that lead to tyranny? Imagine someone asking our PM to force a company or a family to give up 80 percent of their wealth, will they survive afterwards or even during this lockdown? Remember they have to keep their volunteer works happening and take care of their volunteers who are working outside right now.

True that businesses loss money and government's treasury can go empty, but so does religious institutions. They are not getting donations from people now, but are spending their money on relief works. So aren't they affected, too?

Side Note: Everything is God's creation and from that point of view we all are His wealth. So what does he mean by God's wealth? Paper money?;Valid point. Religous bodies sit on huge piles of money.

Tax religous and political donations and we will clean up the country fast. Else it will be the same shit different colour.;Do you really think Gobmint would use it to fight disease? Maybe they will give a vaccine contract to some Ambani.;IndiaToday has no original thought or criticism and is spineless for saying "" a lot of sense even though it comes from a class 10 student and not some expert. The letter is creative, empathetic and totally hits the point home!"". Yikes.

The last thing we need is bored kids flooding the news with their letters that took them ten minutes to write. Why stop with a single page? Maybe write a twenty page document perhaps after due research. Does he want modi to announce in demonetisation style, ""From tomorrow, 80% of your money is now mine!""

Where did he pull the 80% number from? Why not start with 1%? A lot of religious institutions have physical assets and investments - like land, buildings, educational institutions (like this kid's school). No sane organization will have 80% of its wealth as just money. Even the PMNRF FAQ states that surplus is ""invested in various forms with scheduled commercial banks"". 

What happens when PMNRF gets the money? Is the PM going to send cash to poor people? What about food? Who decides which states get how much money? How much time is that going to take to reach the needy? 

Many religious institutions feed the poor every day even before this crisis. They already have infrastructure (kitchens) and people on the ground to prepare hundreds, if not thousands of meals a day. Its easier to urge them to use this infrastructure to prepare and then for the government to distribute meals instead of going about this in a roundabout way.

How about not spending thousands of crores on statues and military? Even individual states make more money from liquor than the funds that PMNRF has. Of all the ideas, the kid chose the one which is most difficult to implement and would be met with most resistance.;Hindu temples have already donated, how about masjids?;Yeesh don't see this happening...

They are doing whatever they can even as we speak, mosques, temples and churches, I've heard are doingi whatever they can to help, demanding like 80% isn't practical and is ignoring the help these religious organizations do to help the societies that they are in.

Airport food is usually 10-20% more expensive but not 2x-3x times like in India.;I don't understand, why do people buy from them? An average movie is about 2 hours. You couldn't eat anything before coming to the movie? Why buy such overpriced snack? Just buy a packet of biscuit and eat it before entering the hall.;In the US, I can get a movie ticket for 14$ and large tub of popcorn with free refill (put together probably five times larger than the largest you can get in PVR) and a coke medium size for less than 12. That is, a single movie ticket price is more expensive than the stuff you buy for a party of two. Somehow they managed to get the equation reversed in India the stuff costs more than the movie ticket itself. WtF?;Who in their right mind orders overpriced food items outside the movie theater?;I recently went to Insignia Inox, which has like a base ticket price of 800, but it was a morning show so a lot cheaper. And you go in, and you have like a button to calla butler, and you have Menus next to you. They sell Dahi Puri for 300;While we are on the topic. Can we pls notice that even after literally paying money you STILL GET FUCKINNNG ANNOYING ADS! 
YouTube is better at least it’s totally free. 
I miss the days where they only show you movie trailers.;Eat at home before you go to watch a movie. Middle class master race :|;Maharashtra mein kya scene hai btw?Allowed to bring your own food kya;I was discussing this with a family member and I said that I would gladly pay 100 Rs extra for a ticket for the freedom to bring my own food. That makes much more sense than charging sky-high prices for food.;*taalis laat;Last time i went to pvr, they charged me nearly 900 rs for a large popcorn and 2 medium Pepsi. Whereas movie ticket price was just 220 rs.;PVR and INOX are actually in popcorn business. ^^/s;recently went to one of the better pvrs. they had flavored popcorns that they gave out in ziplock bags. we took a medium for 220 bucks chocolate flavor. they were so good and so fulfilling. it was pretty great for 220 bucks. two of us shared that pack and we struggled to finish it off.  

next time went to a not so great pvr. paid 220 for similar popcorn. and it was garbage stale stuff. 

this is what annoys me.;Why suddenly people are posting memes in this sub?;I feel that they rob us in broad daylight. If questioned that start to fight. Sanki people I must say.;PVR is solely the culprit for exorbitant food prices in cinemas. Before PVR expanded nationally, local cinema chains used to offer Popcorn Pepsi combo for 150 and samosa for 40. After looking at PVR's fat margins, other cinema chains got greedy and followed suit.;Lol in Cinepolis the medium size popcorn and the large size popcorn price difference is only 10 rupees , so whenever you order medium ,the guy tells you that large costs only 10 rupees more , so you buy the large one anyways also they sell fucking Vada pav for 100 rupees that is ridiculous eventhough they use more pósh looking pav and ingredients.;I hate this. Had posted this on Facebook some time back and a 'genius' in my list commented that ""Hey, the cost is high because they're giving you a chance to eat before a large screen."" I was like - that doesn't make any sense.

The concept is of a rental property - you rent a place and you can most definitely have your own food there. For example, hotel room, airplane flight. (The same doesn't hold true for a restaurant because food's the main business of the restaurant. But cinemas? It's bullshit.)

So I told him that cineplexes should be allowed to do one of two things:

1. Don't allow outside food but then charge reasonably
2. Allow outside food and charge whatever they want (like a hotel's restaurant would do).

I also said that I lean towards option 2 because it promotes 'freedom of choice'. It was heartening to see some cities' theatres allow outside food. And here in Australia where I have recently moved, ALL theatres allow outside food, as it should be.;Rs.10 coffee for Rs.150. #savagepvr;And then they demand Rs. 60 for a 500 ml water bottle which is filled with nothing but tap water.;Pespi? Really?;Instagram memes on reddit?;Lol. Didn't know it was that much cheaper 😂😂;Thankfully, most PVRs have started keeping a water cooler and glasses so that if you're just a little thirsty, you don't have to fork out 80 bucks for a whole bottle. Since they don't allow you to bring your own water in. Brighter side I guess.;Popcorn is more expenses than the ticket itself.;Dude I feel this meme to my core. Bought 2 popcorns and 2 pepsis, Rs. 1200+

Wtf.;Taalis lakh when pespi chaalis lakh when Pepsi;PVR: Popcorn Vada raidshow;Taalis Laat;I need more indian memes on reddit;Dank.;Food in cinema is only for crazy rich people.;you have made me watch again this part of the movie;Cold drinks at 300 wtf;not sure if you guys know this but theatres earn very little from ticket sales and most of their earnings come for sales of these food items.;For those complaining about the price, I understand all the frustration but remember that a theater's business model revolves completely on the food and beverage sector. Money from the tickets goes straight to the distributor or the production company. Maybe i am mistaken with how it works in India but as per my understanding, Theater's run only due to the sales of F&B on a daily basis and advertisements before and during intermission of the films;Need a Indian meme sub;why is this so true!;These multiplex chains have three main source of revenue:
1. Ticketing
2. Advertisement
3. F&B (Food & Beverages)

F&B segment has highest margin somewhere between 80-85%.

Unfortunately we will only ever know about their failures & not their successes.;RIP those who died ;And recently that motherfucker got released who masterminded the attacks.;I was there. My college hostel was about a kilometre from Oberoi, Nariman Point. I was walking on the marine drive with a few friends when shots were fired in Oberoi. Cops arrived soon after and asked us to disperse.

I had a really close escape during the Mumbai local bomb blasts too. Was waiting for a friend at Churchgate station and left a train so we could travel together. There was a blast in the first class compartment of the train that we skipped (we both travelled first class).

Fuck terrorism. Fuck ISI for supporting terrorists. And fuck any Pakistani who supports ISI.;Additionally, today is also Constitution Day - When our constitution was adopted.;It feels so sad that the conspirators of this horrible horrible event are let free without any consequences, perhaps even more celebrated in their country. 

But events like these remind us that humanity is still alive. 

Corruption was as rampant in 2008 as in any year, a great portion of government officials were troubling the common man as they still do, the police were as complacent as they are today, but all this did not stop the public from saving the victims of Leopold cafe, Taj, CST. Common people, like you and me, gave their lives just so to save others. 
(Great respect to the officials as well)

This aspect of the attacks is something which we should never forget.;And the perpetrator of those attacks is scott free and receiving support from many in his country. Sad;What a planned timing for the mastermind of this attack to be released. Like a stab in the back.;I used to live a couple of streets away from Nariman house. Still remember watching choppers drop the NSG onto an adjacent building; hearing gunshots and grenades. Terrifying experience. My salute to the NSG.;Guess what Bollywood and the elite are doing? Throwing a fashion show in its name. As hollow as it can get.;This was a sad thing afterall. I was in class 11 that time. For the 3 or 4 days this thing was on, I was perplexed. Life as if was paused. The only thing that you see when you opened TV was this. 

There were two events in Indian media that actually changed things - this and the Nirbhaya gang rape. Both were heavily publicized, to the point that the govt actually moved it ass and took some action. 

What's more sadder is that this thing is a reality even today. Just a couple of days ago, a blast happened in Egypt, taking lives of over 300 people, double the amount of 26/11. A population of size of a small colony in India gone, at an instant. 

Since 26/11, I have studied history of Islam and middle East extensively, read tens of books, to know answers I have always wanted to know - Why? I am more confused than before. It just doesn't get in my head, how a person, who is mostly peaceful at first, and living in communities of mostly peaceful people, can transform himself to become a monster and fill himself with hatred. 

Terrorism because of insurgency I can understand and get my head around - Kashmir, North East, etc. Strapping a bomb and killing normal civilians - who have nothing to do with you? That part I will never be able to get into my head. ;1. Best friends brother in law lost his eye ( behind Stock Market 1992 Bombing) - this is 23 years

I was married to a Pakistani, a Hindu - 20 years ago, they are not sensitive towards our feeling, they think this is a joke - my ex passed on a comment near her friend about how our countries should make up and ""hum becharo ko Dawood mil jaye"", I spoke to her about it and how this is not a joke ( they left Pakistan coz of ill treatment towards Hindus even for upper middle class, but when your born in a place, your feeling are tied towards it. My divorce was not due to political reasons FYI ) and if you ever saw live comments on Youtube on 26/11, a decent Pakistani would be ashamed of his countrymen on the filth and happiness shown by them. I still don't blame every Pakistani, just a general viewpoint that they feel we did this to ourselves and even if some died, no big deal coz we are doing so many in Kashmir.
This Saeed is just one small pawn in a bigger scheme of things, Pakistani govt has done far worse in the past - this is just another killer they are sleeping with;Don't forget news media channels that live streamed this incident compromising security forces. They have blood on their hands.;A big thank you from the entire country to all the heroes who saved us.;NEVER FORGET ;Just thankful to the authorities for keeping us safe since. I don't think we have had any incident in the past 5-6 years at least.;When tragedies happen in other countries, say 9/11 they are honored every year and people who suffered in the tragedy are remembered.

I have been on social media all day and didn't see one post about this, it's fucking sad man;I remember I was 8 when it happened. My first brush with terror with some conscience. I still didn't understand the scale of the attacks even a bit, but going back later, seeing documentaries, it was really gut-wrenching. RIP those innocent... ;I hope the government officials become aware of the repercussions of their complacent and careless attitude and start giving priority to security of not only VIPs but also ordinary citizens.;Healing is good, but some people just want to see the world burn.;The bastard terrorist Hafiz Said was freed today by terror state pakistan.

Bullet points from Modi's speech:

* We need to take a new solid step to fight black money. **From now on, Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes will not be used. Have 50 days to turn them into banks and post offices.**
* **On November 9 and in some places on November 10, ATMs will not work.**
* Respite for people for the initial 72 hours, government hospitals will accept old Rs. 500 and 1000 notes till 11 November midnight.
* Petrol pumps and retail outlets will have to keep every single entry of cash transaction with 500 and 1000 notes till November 11.
* Crematoriums and cemeteries will also be allowed to transact 500 and 1000 notes till November 11. 
* There will be no change in any other form of currency exchange be it cheque, DD, payment via credit or debit cards etc.
* Those unable to deposit Rs. 1000, Rs. 500 notes by December 30 for some reason, can change them till March 31, 2017 by furnishing ID proof
* Notes of Rs. 2000 and Rs. 500 will be circulated soon, RBI has decided to limit the notes with higher value;More than anything else, how the whole thing happened without even a single media source getting a sniff is commendable.;Fucking funny, got the message 500 and 1000 banned on whatsapp from two people .

Now anyone with extra cash will immediately be under the taxman's lens;The surprise element is what really amazes me. It's good that Modi retained the surprise as much as possible. Even though the 2000 note was somewhat leaked I don't think anyone would have guessed that 500 and 1000 are being withdrawn. So the fake currency holders and black money hoarders got a huge blow for sure.

Hope this exercise bears a lot of fruit. ;To all the stupid merchant outlets (KFC/McD) who have their card machines perpetually out of order. 

Fucked.;My watchman is crying and freaking out as he just got paid with 500s and 1000s.

Me  ;Fucking hell, I'm not a Modi supporter, but the balls on this guy, wew lad!;The great thing about this is, no one saw this coming.   

On CNBC TV18 the way people are reporting, it seems that no one knew that govt will take such a step. Also Deepak Parekh, Chairman of HDFC himself  mentioned 2 times how quietly did RBI manage to pull this! Hope It works.

 Edit : Even the Economic affairs secretary didn't see it coming so quietly! ;This is a great step by Modi.

Some highlights :

* Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000  old notes will be discontinued from midnight. Have 50 days to turn them into banks and post offices. Prior to that last day to turn old notes in RBI offices is 31st March 2017.

* On November 9 and in some places on November 10, ATMs will not work.

* On November 9 banks will be closed for other public works

* Respite for people for the initial 72 hours, government hospitals will accept old Rs. 500 and 1000 notes till 11 November midnight.

* Petrol pumps and retail outlets will have to keep every single entry of cash transaction with 500 and 1000 notes till November 11.

* Crematoriums and cemeteries will also be allowed to transact 500 and 1000 notes till November 11.

* There will be no change in any other form of currency exchange be it cheque, DD, payment via credit or debit cards etc.

* Those unable to deposit Rs. 1000, Rs. 500 notes by December 30 for some reason, can change them till March 31, 2017 by furnishing ID proof at RBI nodal offices.

* Notes of Rs. 2000 and Rs. 500 will be circulated soon, RBI has decided to limit the notes with higher value.

* The maximum amount comprising of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes which can be withdrawn in a day is restricted to Rs 2000 per day and Rs 10000 per week, this amount will be increased in coming days. 

Please correct me If I am wrong.;Fuck me. Have around 50K at home in 500s and 1000s thanks to my ATM allergic parents. I have to go and get it changed soon. Also, fuck me again for paying 1600 as cash at a shop just 30 minutes back. All in 100s.

Other than that, good move. Should have a heavy impact on low/mid level black money hoarders.;gotta give it to the man. massive balls.;Opening bank accounts for subsidies was an important step that enabled this.

Mastermind Modi!;I personally am so glad. All the holders of black money in the mattresses at home will suffer. I love what Modi is doing here.;This is absolutely brilliant by Modi. Best part about this was the secrecy. Such a massive operation carried out in complete secrecy. All of the banks, across India were informed about this and the ""Media"" couldn't even catch a glimpse.

I can finally say I'm proud of this government. 

Thanks Modi!;Right step in the right direction.

IMO this great step but enforcement will be key which in India is a process that  moves at a snails pace.;Wow. Everything fits in. This was his plan all along. He kept throwing hints but no one caught it. This might sound like a fanboy thought but it does line up for me:

- Right after getting elected, he announced Jan Dhan Yojna. Yes, bank officials would later on fake numbers by creating dummy account but he gave even the most poor a chance to come under the banking scheme.
- Earlier this year, govt changed laws requiring jewellers to produce customer's tax documents for any purchase above 2 lacs.
- He then allows people with black money to come forward. These people have to be the happiest bunch right now. They must be thinking that we took a great deal, even if it meant paying taxes.
- Then, he does the unthinkable and makes a move very few people would have guts to make.
- Even my uncles (who buy TV and cars in cash) are going to feel the pinch, and I'm loving it!  :D"

And I did Inner Engineering as that's the first thing one had to do in Isha Yoga. There are like 5-6 other levels. I thought this would be something of a Yoga and spiritual exercise type sessions. 

After my course, I started volunteering because my girlfriend was very much into it. And little exercise did no harm to anybody, until their so called head person spotted me being very proactive during volunteering. They started involving me in their meetings. I was hesitant initially but then I just went with the flow. Organisation part was all fine, but then they did something weird. 

One of the members invited me to their house for Bhairavi pooja. I thought its some normal type pooja. Oh boy, I was wrong. Whole thing felt like a cult. Everyone went into this trance and I'm there sitting, wondering why the fuck did I agree to this. After that I talked about my discomfort to the senior members and like any logic minded man I left. After a while I distanced myself from the organisation slowly. 

There are few things I noticed which I strongly disliked. It's all class based. All were upper caste Hindus and Christians. And if there was anyone from outside their circle, that person was not involved into their activities. They all gossip. It felt like I was into a kitty party. You're not allowed to criticize Sadhguru. He's clearly less spiritual and more hindutva. I used to question regarding that to the teachers but i was shut down by giving some vaguely spiritual answer.

My father suffered a near fatal stroke and his recovery has been slow. We took discharge from the hospital and due to the rising cases of covid-19 and also the doctor suggested to take him home. 

But the fate was not on our side. He started coughing a little bit and had fever. We were still feeding him from feeding tube. Today his health was a little bit down so we decided to take him to the hospital and they screened all of us for Covid-19 due to the symptoms. Fortunately we all are negative. 

In the x-ray,it's showing that his left lung has collapsed completely. These last 2 months have really been awful for us especially for my mother as she isn't really coping well. 

The doctors have suggested there may be pneumonia or positional collapse involved in this case.

But it was nothing short of spectacular. 

I'll go on 19th and go in every fucking rally in the city that the university kids are organising.
I saw so many of them in first year when I was a senior and they were kids. Now seeing them bravely organising and leading from the front was just mind-blowing.

Best of all - two kids probably class 11-12 were walking along the rally in South Kolkata. They looked slightly nervous. I saw an old communist with the typical leftie jhola and chador walk up to them and tap them on their shoulder.

He asked if they were in school and they nervously replied yes. The old man said ""bhalo laglo dekhe"" -""am happy to see you guys here"". The old man walked ahead and then I saw these two kids whispering to each other and then suddenly they left the footpath and joined the rally and started shouting slogans right in the middle. 
The happiness on their faces and that entire incident unfolding was my best experience at the rally yesterday.;It's the emperor who has no clothes today.

There is a huge contradiction between what she says and what her org's report says.;That's 0.000004% of the population.;India is an Oligarchy masquerading as a Democracy.

But that doesn't negate the fact that the income inequality is grave indeed. The process of wealth trickling down from top to bottom has been quite inefficient and pre-existing social stratification hasn't helped. People who are in position of power have maintained their hegemony and opportunities created haven't kept the pace with the population explosion resulting in amplified inequality over the years.;Should trickle down eventually;The article is good for nothing.

Also i had seen in some episode of VICE few years ago on discovery (maybe). Japan and china for example. The general public there are quite racist as well. They praise white people like gods while treating their own with racism. Their love for fair skin and belief that fair skinned people are superior still exists. In Japan they did a test in that show they dressed a white guy like a doctor and he joined a conference of real doctors while not being a doctor cuz geuss what he is white and btw this is a profession in japan. White people act as backup chief geust and stuff in such occasion and most people believe them cuz white people are highly educated and superior. This is what Nukes impact on proud country (which was know for samurais and their strong pride of a warrior ideology). 

Imperial rules impact is also a big reason of these discriminative behavior among India. Ik it also include the fact our people are stupid.

If it was a country, UP will be the fifth most populous country. What’s more, of the most populous countries, only one, Nigeria, has a population that’s growing faster than Uttar Pradesh’s.

Uttar Pradesh would be among the poorest countries in the world, and easily the poorest compared with the 10 most populous countries.

But he gets more credit than he deserves.;Canadian Munda;I grew up watching him, he's an icon and an inspiration for our generation. I don't necessarily agree with his views on nationalism, tough. Saw one of his interview recently, he genuinely believes his nationalistic films are:  
1. Exact truth, no fiction. (Irony is, he said he doesn't read books (or in general), so probably he doesn't know any better to distinguish between facts and fiction)

2. Bringing about social change in society. (For an instance he claimed that after pad-man, people started talking about periods openly, even in metro cities. If he really thinks he's making most of his celebrity-status to bring about social change through his mediocre, hardly accurate, toxic-nationalism filled films (and preposterous ads), then he should look at what Aamir khan has done with Satyamev-Jayate and Paani foundation);Maple leaves would be more apt.;You mean the patriotic movie in which the *British* are hailed as 'heroes'? ;Hypothetically speaking, if his movies stop making money because of his Canadian nationality.

Why does he have a Canadian passport? It makes life lot easier when you have to travel a lot is one of the reasons. Other could be that this guy is a ""desh drohi"".  
Has he made any efforts for supporting Canada in any Canadian patriotic way? Well not that I know of. 

Also, How much work has he put towards Indian awareness through movies? Well 8 movies as a quick google search indicates. Also note that these movies don't earn THAT much but still the effort is noted.

So he has done work for India in the form of spreading awareness/information about India's history in the form of movies. He didn't have to do these movies, and it wasn't just money in my opinion. Still his work inspires a lot of people and that's whats important. Why do we need him to have a Indian passport if it will make his life harder. I'll take a person who works as a patriot than who is an ""Official"" patriot.   
And before you compare him to soldiers, just stop and think about how many people are just normal citizens, work in offices and are contributing through economy, and how many of them are patriots. Stop with these stupid comparisons.;All the morons here saying this guy makes nationalism bait movies just because he holds Canadian citizenship. Now I know most of you pappus don't know the significance of holding a Canadian passport (it's one of the most powerful passports in the world and let's you travel without hassle from foreign authorities) as compared to India's because most of you still don't even have an Indian passport (and still daydream of moving to America and marrying a gori madam). 

This guy pays crores in taxes every year and is the biggest tax payer of Bollywood. He doesn't have an obligation to pay even a single paisa to the Indian government but he still does it and that in my opinion is more patriotic than holding a piece of paper that says you're an Indian.

Edit: He has been displaced by Salman Khan for the last two years but is still at second place while Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachchan pay less taxes than him.;what is wrong in it. Maybe he likes his parent country and uses canadian passport for personal benefits. Atleast he is acting in patriotic movies which can inspire people ;[removed];Incorrect fact. He doesn’t hold a Canadian passport. Canadian govt offered him a ‘honorary citizenship’ for his achievements in acting, that’s it. A honorary citizenship means nothing in reality when compared to a real citizen. It is like honorary doctorates given by universities to celebrities, which again, is nothing but kind of recognition of ones achievement. Canadian govt keeps giving honorary citizenship to many people. AKSHAY KUMAR HOLDS AN INDIAN PASSPORT."

My dad said my grandpa had one. It’s a sight hound. Just have to make the rabbit run out of its hole. Then we can go home. Like fire and forget missile. It will bring that rabbit back home, live, without any damages. And get head of rabbit as reward. 



these native breed dogs doesn’t need much attention like those imported breeds.  Just few vaccines shits and you are good to go. It can live on food we eat (few restrictions like salt, sugar...) and stay healthy. 


Also Rajapalayam dogs were grown on farms for safety. Known for not taking treats from strangers unlike most of the imported breeds. 

**Edit:**


forgot to add this story of my relative who had even rare than this Rajapalayam & chippiparai. 


It’s called Manda nai (nai=dog) found in Rameshwaram district 

It was kidnapped twice because of its rarity and managed to get back home.


Second time it was tied using steel wires on both it legs and chained I think. It still managed to come back home several KMs limping with those tied limbs. It had deep cut in all limbs because of wires. Bruises in neck, maybe because of chain & damages all over the body. It wasn’t even properly trained and raised like a street dog in village.

Almost as soon as I met the dog, I was petting him. My friend later on told me that breed is very aggressive, and I should not pet them;Nice. I myself have a Kombai who is 14 years old. Indian dogs rock!! :-);I want to take Raja on a date. Where do I sign up? ;Oh my, these ones are absolute beasts. They can still be trained to hunt or guard livestock. But I last saw them around Vilathikulam as stray dogs. apparently a local King bought them there but they became strays soon after he died a few centuries ago.;But aren't you also doing it wrong by keeping them in confined spaces? I assume this is an apartment or similar, and if yes, don't Rajapalayam require a lot of activity and spaces? My friend bought one (against a lot of argument from a well known breeder in the area) for his city house (he had fairly large open space luckily) but the dog jumped the fence and left off (probably not realizing it did). The breeder had warned him that Rajapalayams are excellent dogs but they are athletic and needs a lot of action and space. Confining them to urban spaces is a torture. Similar to how huskies are tortured in Indian heat. I don't own either, just curious to know how your experience have been in that particular front.;But where is the status in getting an Indian breed!;OP super cute dogg! 13/10.

But I cannot be the first one to see his well manicured (or is it pedicured) nails! Super nice to see a well cared for dog :)

Happy birthday!!;Glad to see that someone is still having Indian breed.  Super macchi 👌👌;Is *Rajapalayam* the name of this breed ? I'll be advising my friends all over to get these puppers if so. Thanks for the share !!;Very cute. Happy Birthday! ;Cute boi. Happy birthday and lots of belly rubs! xoxo;Love love love ♡ Bless you both! :);So cute! Do you call him Rajam for short?

- ""millenials are taking ola-uber instead of taking loans for new vehicles that's why Auto-industry is not flourishing""
- ""Rahul Gandhi (pappu) has welcomed rapists to rape all the women in India"" where as her own party contains Chinmayanand, MJ Akbar, Sunil Sehegar (sorry I didn't remember the last name correctly)

This is what puzzles me where were this students, social communities, good citizens 
- when GDP per capita was decreasing or 
- education was getting costly or 
- people over 23 of age were sitting at home without jobs even after applying and trying hard 
- when higher Taxes were literally shutting down many small clothes, plastic, cosmetic, etc kind of shops.

Sorry, I don't wanna reveal the phone model but it's a ₹10K phone with Camera2 API enabled and I'm using Pixel 2 camera app with video stabilisation on and recording at HD 720p.

I stood for half an hour near the coach door for this shot. The thing is I wanted the fields to start close to the tracks which is usually not the case, mostly there are trees near the tracks and then the fields start, so had to wait for this particularly clean patch. The videos taken before this were taken when the train was in speed but this was when the train had stopped and started to speed slowly; hence, got the stability and steadiness  which is not possible when the train is travelling at 50kmph .  

The ~~man(zombie)~~ farmer is probably planting paddy.

In any other society, this would qualify as something demanding people's attention. There would be efforts made towards helping these people out, educating them towards leading a saner, hygienic and healthy lifestyle.

But, in India, they instead get raved on about on social media for their 'fashion' and *killa* style. 

Edit: Downvoting me or going after my religion won't change ground realities. Besides, I never went after anyone's religion. Merely pointed out the 'societal' aspects of a community. In conclusion, nothing is as fragile, or as hypocritical, as the collective Liberal Hindutva ego. "

BJP gets ~39% vote share vs AAP at ~53%. Where as in 2015 (BJP has 32% vs AAP at 54%)

Despite so much development, AAP lost seats and vote share. And BJP gained.
If anything, it's a moral victory for bigots proving that their divisive politics can make dent and hurt honest politics.

Infact, I consider this as a shame on Delhi!;Didn't AAP win with a huge majority last time as well. Why is them winning again being seen as a big deal?;Hyderabadi - Amdavadi \[Sarkhej Consituency :'(\] here. I second you.;Desaffronization (or avoiding saffronizining) of the states is always welcome. But I have so many things to be concerned.

1. INC can claim that they gave moral support to AAP so that the votes don't get divided. But that's just because it was extremely weak to start with. And even if it did do it with nothing but pure love for country in heart, it's a sad state of affairs when the main opposition party of the country which is supposed to tackle the Bhagwa brigade is reduced to this level in the capital itself.

2. Vote share of BJP in 2015 Assembly elections - 32.2. that too in the peak of Modi wave. 
Approx vote share of BJP in 2020 assembly elections - 38.43.
The vote share (and seats) actually increased. 
The Shaheen bagh vs us campaign DID work.

3. Leaders like Manish Sisodiya won by 3k votes. He was trailing since the morning. And he is second in command as well as the one who is given credit for educational reforms. This could have been a disaster. A loud phew.

4. AAP did a good amount of work but it can not be denied that freebies played an important role. Spending 1720 crores on subsidies out of 1790 crore energy budget is one of the things. How will it play out in future when there can not be any more freebies?

So congratulations for today. 
But miles to go....;Sorry to burst the bubble but it's just because we have kejriwal. If it was Congress vs bjp, bjp would have won with a huge margin. I see people daily which are brainwashed by the duo along with media.
I hope kejriwal moves to other states and perform better there so we have someone against Modi in the center. It will be a long road but surely achievable.;I am gutted I'm out of Delhi and could not vote...not that AAP needed mine but I would have been proud even more...having said that, no hopes from BJP at all...someone else will have to bring the change, like AK is already doing...hats off to him and my dilli;Its best to see that troll, Bagga trailing;Dekhi wale mitro, bahut sahi kam kara!

Thank you, Delhi people.;Breath with aadhar.;I'm a Delhiite and Breathing polluted air is fun...

Winter is coming! I'm excited.


/s;I was in Delhi a few years ago, we have a large family living there. They have a beautiful house in Gurgaon next to Crowne Plaza. The neighbourhood is beautiful too. Seeing all that, it made me feel so helpless with the air quality. It’s a real hardship breathing that air but what can you do when the whole family is already well settled there? (I ask myself this but I have no answer). Some family members are irreplaceably connected to Delhi as some are working as university lecturers. It’s such a contrast to see the kids having a great childhood - minus the air quality which is beyond scary. The air can get so bad, it’s terrifying. Even the eyes can feel the sting. 

And also Gurgaon, there are so many interesting places there. You really want to go and see everything and explore it but there are many days when you can’t get out of the house because the air will make you feel sick. 

I think I understand how the people of Delhi feel = trapped. It’s a great city to live in especially if you are well settled there or have a large settled family. But the pollution is so scary you feel like running out of there.;Delhi se *<cough> <cough>*....

She's doing a disservice to all the other mothers of the country who actually need that maternity leave. The kid needs calm environment not the stressful routine of a bureaucrat's life.

And what if this lady cites her own example and forces people to work under her when actually they need to be somewhere else?

No way I'm going to consider her as a model bureaucrat. She's like that kid in the school and college who will do whatever it takes to finish homework, come to the class even in floods and unnecessarily be the star-kid in the eyes of the teacher. I so don't want this culture to be promoted.;Not a good news, IAS officers come in daily contact with many people. I would worry about **three** people handling a baby daily in current circumstances.;Nice PR;Doesn't India have laws regarding paid maternity leave? Why would you come to your job with your child, especially in such times?

I'm sorry, but I find nothing praiseworthy here.;With the daily rise in covid cases which everyone knows can be deadly for infants and oldage... she's bringing her child to prove what? She's the only hardworking mother in this world? And what dafaq ppl congratulating her for?;She still let photographers into her office to click this photo when it was not absolutely necessary , so how well is she protecting her baby again ?;I am glad to find a lot of comments here calling her out. Even removing the dangerous situation she is putting her child in the current state of affairs, this is nothing praiseworthy or exemplary. Women who have delivered baby/had csection needs proper rest and recovery period. That's why maternity leave exists. I had to go back to work at 12 weeks leaving my newborn to a care taker. I had to pump 3 times at office and still be productive as my male colleagues. After coming from office, I don't have time to rest because I need to relieve the care taker and let her rest. I couldn't sleep well, because baby needs to be fed every few hours through night as well. Then there is the overhead of cleaning and sterilizing bottles and pump parts. Delivery is traumatic. Csection is a major surgery. Women should be allowed to recover and dedicate their time to their babies before joining back to workforce. They will be more productive that way. Glorifying toxic work culture is more damaging than anything.;I feel this is just a publicity gimmick!

Why is that so many IAS officers who are doing some incredible work (especially related to tribal people) are not publicised? Why are they not seen in trending news or searches?;Wait, I thought maternity leave is compulsory. A female can waive the leave?;While I'm impressed with her dedication, I agree with every other commenter. She is jeopardising the child's life by coming in to work in this scenario. 

Plus, maybe I'm jaded but this feels more like a publicity stunt than anything else. Feel free to correct me. I'm a pessimistic person by nature and I feel like this is just a show to prove how ""work trumps all"" is her motto or whatever.

But on a cheerier note, congratulations on the baby. I wish him a healthy wonderful life.;Any reason why her husband cannot take care of the child? It's not a good environment for the baby.;Can we please stop glorifying IAS? They're the primary reason India is so backward;Well I went back to work after 5 days.

So I guess everything depends on babies mood now, new born are unpredictable.


I appreciate her working but bringing a baby with u all time wont help her get any work done. 


There is reason women have maternity leaves.


You can give me shit for my comment but this is truth I have closely seen new borns being raised and how the act;IAS Officers get 6 month maternity leave. 22 days too less, she should have used at least 2 month off.;This is setting a bad example. This shows that there is backup for her tasks in her absence that she had to come to work.

A woman being deprived of her maternity leave just because of some work that she has to do at office is nothing to be applauded.;SETTING. WRONG. EXAMPLES.;Out here in the US, this is common.  My sister just gave birth,  and returned to work a week later while our parents look after the child.

She's doing a disservice to her child, her family and setting up wrong examples. 

There was this headline few weeks back that a male Japanese official took paternal leave, which is frowned upon in Japan, to set spend time with the new born and to emphasize it's important.;Appreciate the effort not the move;Nice Photo OP.;As someone from the civil service rightly pointed out... this seems to make the 6 month maternity leave look like a sham.

This is how low we can go;Pretty much of an attention seeking behaviour. How many times a newborn baby breast feeds and how many times it would spoil the nappy? How is she going to manage this? Long back, there were news about women who were menstruating and also at the same time running in a race. That was not actually needed but the way social media is flattering women, they are likely to do such publicity stunts. While many would appreciate her ""commitment to work"" it is the fragile child who is likely to suffer.;You dont take the fucking baby to the work. Thats  nothing to be proud of... leave the baby at home ffs;Many poor labour women have to go back to lifting weights on their heads immediately after delivery, an IAS just has to sit on a chair in an air conditioned room with servants at her disposal, just a comparison.;Go home aunty;I feel like I should clarify given that she is currently posted in my city, Visakhapatnam. The reason she returned early is because during this time of crisis it would have been hard for the replacement to get to terms with communicating with multiple departments. I reckon she will manage things for a bit and take the rest of the leave later?; 

# IAS Officer Refuses 6-Month Maternity Leave amid COVID-19 Crisis, Joins Work with Month-Old Baby

Gummalla replied to the post stating that she was taking “every precaution with the baby.”

“I  keep the baby with me in a very protected environment, for feeding and nurturing. Thanks a lot again, all of you,” she wrote on Twitter.

Speaking to news agency ANI, Gummalla explained that she would go home every four hours to feed her son and return to work and that her husband and mother took turns to care for her child in her absence.

If she had taken maternity leave: ""This is why it's better not to have women officers. In times of crisis, you can't count of them.""

If she brings the baby in to work so the baby still has her company "" BAD MOM. ENDANGERING THE LIFE OF THE BABY.""

**No one here has any right to sit on their high horses and judge this person.** This subreddit probably sounds like this woman's MIL. We don't know the circumstances around which she made this choice. Anyone saying that her choice should be prioritizing her baby - well she *has*. In the way that *she (the actual mother)* felt is right. Unless you don't believe a woman is a human person who is capable of making her own independent choices and should be treated like a child who doesn't know better.

Really, women can't win. Let this lady do what she wants. It's clear few people on this subreddit have been mothers.  Has anyone here even had a child? Do you know how fucking difficult it is 22 days after giving birth? Believe me, if she didn't feel she *had* to be in the office, she ***wouldn't***.  Not all jobs are created equal.  Does anyone berate the fathers of newborn babies leaving their families for defense services? No? Why not? Because that service is more than their fatherly duties. In this case, this mom has sacrificed her maternity leave for the greater good - what she feels is right. It's not our job to say otherwise unless you are berating fathers for getting back to their jobs right after their babies are born too.  If my job was essential (civil services is an essential job, btw) and I had to come in,  and my boss was supportive and flexible about breastfeeding and bringing my baby to work,  I 100% would if I were physically able. And she **clearly** is.

Also, why are people saying that the baby will be in danger in a cushy office? that makes no sense. In the home, the baby has exposure to equal contaminants (grandparents, famiy, maids, drivers, guests, etc).  It's ridiculous to think the office is suddenly more dangerous. In fact, one has more privacy in the office to breastfeed than at home with in-laws, maids, and guests  there all the time.

Please don't come at me saying I am against parental leave rights. I am all for 6 months of paid leave for both parents. I am just trying to address the judgemental as fuck responses on this thread. **Blame the system, not the person.**"

Should Nolan have included a few Indian faces? Yes.

Bhanwari Devi was gang raped in presence of her husband who was tied and beaten up while her wife was raped. She was on govt of Rajasthan's payroll to inform the administration about child marriages.

She reported a child marriage and the family 'Raped her to teach her a lesson'.

When she went to file FIR against the culprits, police asked her to deposit her 'Lehnga' as an evidence. She covered her lower part with the blood stained turban of her husband and walked 3 Kms to her village.

District court acquitted all accused and made the following remarks in the judgement:

1) It is hard to believe that the wife was raped in front of the husband and he didn't retaliate.

2) No uncle-nephew duo can do rape.

3) No upper caste men can rape lower caste women as that would disgrace their own caste.

You find it hard to believe it coming from the Judiciary?

Believe it or not. This is the truth.

- Five judges were changed till the 6th gave a clean chit to the 5 accused.

But on a total unrelated note Hp and other Printer companies Advertise that Printing costs have reduced a lot .

The price is what the market bears. If it was not profitable people would be getting out of the business, like the std/pco booths which are no more. It is smart marketing no doubt.;Is this at Adyar Student Xerox?;I have seen this in 50% photocopy place in pune from last 6 months;Wow, people bargain for photocopies?

Uber, Ola: No way to contact customer service directly, have to submit ticket and wait for them to call you. The drivers are all corrupt, 8/10 (bangalore) they will call you up to ask for your destination (which they are not supposed to know) then if they dont like it or if you refuse to tell them they will waste your time sitting in some gully trying to force you to cancel. Yes, it is 8 times out of 10, i am not exaggerating.

Swiggy, zomato etc - complete garbage. They take the payment but take 0 real responsiblity for what is delivered. Have had 500 rs orders only half delivered, and they refuse to replace or refund giving me a 50 rupee coupon for 250 rupees worth of missing items. Like what the fuck is that? If I wanted to just give away money id stand on a bridge and throw it.

Pizza hut, dominos, other international chains: Completely 100% indianized, only chicken (religous issue? even UAE pizza hut has pork on their menu), KFC removes fries from its menu (but they sell burgers, wtf? and fries are known, world around, to be the highest margin fast food item).

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

ISPs: shit customer service all-round, high speed, yes, but poor connections with high latency, blocking of websites (disgusting to freedom of information)

Mobile service providers: cheap AF, completely overbooked, infrastructure cant cater to the number of people they take on, get 0.2mbps 4g in metros like mg road bangalore even at 2 o clock on a weekday night.

Autos: meter is just for show, at least in bangalore, aggressive, misbehaved if you dont haggle with them off the meter. Dont even know the roads properly.

Cops: useless 100%, show they are advanced with twitter, facebook and incident report apps, 0% response rate (tried to report noise level issue in my area from a nearby construction site, over 30 complaints over 2 months, tweets, facebook messages, no response. One time a cop showed up wasted more of my time than doing anything, takes my picture for some reason, and fucks off.

Even other poorer nations, and other 3rd world countries, are not as shit as ours when it comes to decenly and proper service, public behaviour, etc. This is the shittiest country in the world, to be honest, fuck your Indian pride (proud of what?).

goddamned cesspool",Whats with this country and its standards?,0.9,"First time?;Had the same problem when I moved from USA to India. I can proffer you the following reasons:- 

a. Extremely cost sensitive market. The problem is that once you start offering tradespeople extra premium to do high quality work, even then these people end up doing sub-standard work. So, this is not completely a function of low pay; the skills are way sub-par too.

b. Attention to detail is tremendously low here.

c. Indians tend to not go deeply into things and really understand things  on superficial level.;When a society wants to pay AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE for everything, eventually all products and services reflect that and become barely usable.;Uber, Ola: Aggregators have made the margins so narrow on the driver partners, that the drivers have reduced the level of service across the platform. 

Swiggy, zomato etc - Same problem.;Basically, no pride in getting the job done, and no decency. In Japan, it’s shame that needles people to have high standards. In the US, it’s the heavy costs on irregularities (legal recourse and lawsuits for anything). We have neither, and we are poor and desperate to bend everything to our advantage. 

Like you alluded to: in a poor society, work culture, decency, quality shouldn’t be its corollaries. Rather they should be prime motivators to move out of it.;We don't have much real love for the country. We will trash Pakisthanis online and throw waste here and there. Some of it is justified because it is already shitty. But still when we think it is like what difference can one person make?

Also, no one abuses good systems like us. A few years ago, my colleague wore a beautiful necklace for a celebration. When another colleague asked her to lend it to her for some family function, she said that she had returned it. She bought it from Amazon, used it and returned the product. Obviously, she was misusing the full refund, no questions asked policy.;Well yeah, Vietnam has similar average income to India, but does everything better. Things are in order, streets are cleaner, business cares about customer, nobody is burning anyone else over religion, they also do very well in international academic competitions.

The next rising economy is going to be Vietnam. They are like the little China back then, with everything else other than money on a higher level, so money would flow in eventually. 

India is a real $2,000 GDP per capita country. All the shit about religion and other stuff happening in India also happen in those African countries on similar level. Go visit China, Vietnam, Kenya, and Nigeria, and you’ll see. Some countries are obviously above their level and will rise, some countries not so much.;I understand your ire, but permit me to give this a constructive twist.

>*Apart from the obvious, trash everywhere ...*

Perhaps you have seen the site [theuglyindian.com](https://theuglyindian.com)?  Don't be discouraged by the name. This is a cleanup of St Marks St in your city, and is a beautiful example of what it takes to have a lasting effect.  Then there's Afroz Shah and his beach/river cleanup efforts in Mumbai. There are people like that in every city, and they do work for which people are immensely grateful. I think it is quite empowering to be on the positive end of it. Do check out their Facebook page as well and join them. 

&#x200B;

>*Electricians, handymen, plumbers .....*

It has taken me a few years, but I have managed to track and retain good, prompt people. There are few proper karigars who do their job well, and it is possible to get their contacts by asking around sites of good builders for referrals. I pay very well, I don't haggle, and I tip the helpers generously. We have a plumber who feels comfortable asking for half a day's pay because that's what it takes him to commute to come to my place and fix a few things. I have no problem. In return, he takes his time, leaves the bathroom and kitchen cleaner than he found it, and fixes other things that I never asked to do in the first place.

I had this same conversation with my brother-in-law last week, while navigating the ever-bonkers Kolkata traffic and its seemingly ‘empty-headed drivers’. None of it makes any sense. Yet, no one complains. There is no outcry about anything. There is no accountability. It just doesn’t make sense. 

I kinda blame it, after thinking about this issue for the last 14 years or so, on the administration or lack thereof. Most of the failings you are talking about and those that you didnt mention - are all legally admonished and there are standards and procedures in place for them all. It is the total failure of our administrative services that none of it is implemented the way it could have been. Red-tape, politicking, bribery, fraud, scams, favouritism, nepotism, eyewash, focus-shift, lack of education, corruption in general etc have fucked this country to high hell. Yet, taxpayers money go to the funds daily to keep the administration alive - which mostly gets pocketed. 



The total apathy of the population towards the state of affairs, based on the shitty ‘as long as I get my daily bread who cares’ attitude is most perplexing. Basic stuff is nonexistent yet they are happy if a certain religion gets fucked or some other stupid inconsequential shit.

This.;Bigg ass country , bigg ass population rip.;Agreed, my mom is a homebaker and makes really tasty cakes (like really good, not even biased here) but most of the people here buy cakes at 400/- kg which taste like shit and the cake spunge tastes like water.

Joke aside though, completely agree with you on a lot of issues. Having lived in UP for over a decade, I feel your pain.

Something that baffles me to no end is why almost everyone I come across, regardless of age, sex or political leanings, is a nationalist in every sense of the word. Patriotism I can understand but Nationalism is a weird thing to see. It's like they are wearing polarized sunglasses that filters out the all the shit that's around them and all they see is how wonderful the country is. 

And not to mention the *Hum Pakistan se aage hain* sentiment that pretty much every Indian is born with nowadays.;Uber drivers are the biggest chutiyas of this country. They can cancel as much as they want without any penalties but customers can't even once. Except a select few, others are all madarchods.;Several issues really,

-	**Education**: Quality of education we receive is probably lowest in comparison to other developing or developed nations. Focus is often more on memorising rather than understanding problems.
-	**Politics**: All politicians ever want to do is get rich, 99% of them are morons, having zero knowledge of what country needs.
-	**Society**: NOBODY wants to take initiatives. ""*Chalta tha, chalta hai, aur chalega*"" attitude. Sorry, but problems don't resolve themselves until you really tackle them. Our population is massive so they may disappear, but that doesn't mean it got solved. People don't give a damn about other people's problems.
-	**Ownership**: (Or lack of it). Someone else's problem is not my problem. I've heard this countless number of times, ""*apna kaam ho raha hai na!*"" We need to own our shit and put efforts towards resolving issues rather than bouncing it to time or someone else.
-	**Laws & Regulations**: This one really boils my blood. We create problems first and then see if nobody notice. If nobody complaints, nothing gets done. Government employees are paid peanuts and they come out of same system as everyone else so quality is 🤷🏻‍♂️.


I'm not saying problems doesn't exist in Developed or other developing nations. They certainly do, but we have huge population that's unique to any other nation. These companies get away with low quality, sub-standard services because 99% of their user base doesn't care.

But hey we are a Socialist country with Capitalist mindset and everything is for sale. So there are 3 simple choices for you here.

1.	Accept the problem, ignore the issues, shut the fuck up, and just get going. You peasant!
2.	Accept the problem, find a solution, create a business around it, buy some babus, and Profit! Sweetest of all, and works if you are up for a challenge.
3.	Accept the problem, find a solution, create a business around it, join the revolution, and disappear if anyone up the chain doesn't like you. Sure, there are laws, and one must trust the system. It is useless to flog a dead horse. Unless you've got a good backing, your family is going to be haunted for siding you.

There'll always be that one person who will change things, again be an Indian and wait for that saviour or *agar gooda hai* (if you've got the will) break this chain and BE THE ONE!;I have to agree. While I wouldn't say it's the shittiest country in the world (North Korea exists) there's a lot of problems in this country we need to address. I'm from the North-East of India, and I've faced racial remarks as well. However, whenever I bring the issue up of my mistreatment I'm immediately labelled an anti-national by basically everybody. Our country has so much damn potential in growth and I still don't get why it's so bad. I study in a private school, and despite how many times we're forced to make STOP LITTERING or WATER IS PRECIOUS posters, I still see kids throw garbage out the bus windows. No matter how much we discuss in class the problems with the caste system I still hear my classmates associate their behaviours or status to their caste. ( 'I'm a brahmin, I can't eat meat' when I'd much rather hear 'I'm a vegetarian'. I wish people would forget about their caste.)

I know that discrimination based off of economic class is illegal now, but from what I have heard, it still exists and is still very much prevalent. I am from America and I know of Indian families in my neighborhood that actively ignore each other because of their Indian roots being different classes. I have Indian friends that talk about how enjoying their parents are when around other Indians.;So true. 

There are neighbours in my area who are bossy. They play DJs after 11PM on occasions. One time, someone complained, police came, the DJ was shut down, police left, DJ started again. Why? Because people here in India have absolutely no respect for the system, their neighbours, flora and fauna and basically everything except their family and their belongings. 

Autos: Meters don't work, in most of the autos. I don't know why but that's not good. Why that is even there if it is not to serve any purpose? Some Auto drivers are very rude and don't drive well enough.  


Builders: Builders only want to make a pile of bricks that can stand till they are sold. Cheap wiring is done that can result in short-circuits. You don't need a drill machine to drill a hole in a wall, just pick up a screw driver and you can make a hole yourself if you apply enough force, they are not like paper, just not as strong as walls should be (only strong part about them is the bricks). Carpenters don't know how to use measurement tools. Plumbers don't know how to  properly fix a fixture. I am not talking about some inexperience builder, rather a builder who has projects spanned across the whole nation and some projects in China. Basically, they are looting people with money. Money which they use to buy expensive homes and cars. They have no regards for their customers safety. 

 ISP: They will try hard to blame your computer is at fault or switching the modem off for 30 seconds can solve all problems. Their servers have a 0% failure rate, requires no maintenance. Yes, your computer is at fault, or have you tried switching the modem off for 30 seconds? Sir?

Politicians: People are dying in the street and their top priority is whether to build a mosque or a temple. Hmmm! Some politics have the guts to speak foul language for women and our Prime Minister. 

By far the biggest culprit is the education system. Since beginning we are taught how too compete with one another, rather than to compete with yourself. Schools and colleges are just money-making institutes. They just care about 100% pass percentage so they can market themselves. They don't impart any real skills that can be used in the industry. The reason Messi and C. Ronaldo can play excellent football is not because they had good academia records, they can do it because they honed their skills with practice and practicality. Sachin can play great cricket because of the same reason. Schools are like 10% practical, 50% theoretical, and 40% about useless stuff like keeping hair short, covering your notebooks with a cover.

Beautiful hotels in wonderful landscape, but all garbage and dirt is just thrown across the garden wall, converting the direct surroundings into a rat infested dump. Nobody will book this again if you've been there once.

People working in highly professional environment but having absolutely no drive and initiative. Even the lead devs needing to get every action and every task meticulously explained leading to the western customer questioning the benefit of working with an Indian partner.

All your posts and answers (ignoring anecdotal stories) gave me some insight into the mindset.

Just a general observation on the worldviews Indians have.
If you take a look at the article, you'll find some comments. The comment section is enlightening.

""Natural couples can procreate, but unnatural cannot..If unnatural is to become a norm, then we have to think seriously of bio-ethical issues arising therefrom..Better go the nature's way though we have got freedom, we can use it either way.""

""Shows a great decline in ethical and value understanding, forgetting what our ancestors (the great rishis) and developing a slavish western educated attitude(so-called modern)
Doom is near when we forget ours roots.""
***
This is a very very *healthy sign* that the times we are livin' in is 1319,not 2019.
As for the rishis,if this gentleman had the time to look into our scriptures,he would find the Ardhanarishwara form(which celebrates feminity). Countless other refutes could be provided.
It's high time,we step up the ante,and counter them. These kind of mentality would only cause our society to move towards an intellectual dark age. 
I'm simply surprised,that every divine pronouncement is taken support to voice his beliefs about ""unnaturality"" and the fact that ""it won't support procreation"".

I don't know if that alone is the reason or what but I have now had accounts with 5 different branches and ones with women staff only perform on a level you would expect citi to function at. 

&#x200B;

One branch I had an account with used to be all female staffed but after demonetisation was changed to mixed staff. I went to the branch on a monday to open a current account but the dude spurned me and said he can't open 1 this week because he has much to do. Mind you I had 3 FDs in this same branch 70 lakhs each. So, I located a new female staff only branch. Went in at 3 in evening, asked the manager for paperwork that was needed (I already knew most of it) and filled it. Next day, Tuesday, I brought in my mum in whose name the account was to be made and by 4 o'clock that day, my account was done. Next day, I transferred about 30 lakhs in the account and immediately, they gave me an emergency chequebook and gave me all services (I did about 3 RTGSs that day with debit slips). 

&#x200B;

Even now, any time I go to that branch, if its 2 to 2:30, I just fill my request form or my NEFT/RTGS slip and along with cheque, give it to the guard. After lunch time, he passes it to concerned personnel and by 4, the UTR number is in my phone. They even entertain me between customers. I'll just slip in the filled form and cheque and they'll say it'll be done by lunch and it is done by that time. Even after 4 when they close the bank doors to do the day's work, if I come to the bank, the guard will take my RTGS slip (they gave me about 20 leaflets so I can fill them out at home rather than fidget around in bank) and pass it on and I'll receive the SMS. Only once (out of about 50 RTGSs and about 2.73 Cr worth of money transfer) has a payment failed (was credited back immediately). Also, during tax season (august), I was out of town so I called them to provide me with acc statement and they mailed it to me (when I mailed them my official requirement on company pad) in about 1 hour.

I wonder how effective capital punishment is as a deterrent if this is the mentality of people like him.;AP Singh, rapists lawyer said he would have burnt his own daughter if she goes out in night.

Rapists can die but social conservatism and patriarchy will have to die if India were to have women's safety and freedom. 

Our so called culture is **CRAP** and everyone still defends it. Every conservative family's ""honour"" is tied to their daughter's vagina. Pathetic. I wonder what drives them to burn their daughter with petrol if she went out with a guy?

Bajrang Dal goons and VHP and other right wing goons also deserve the same fate for moral policing. On 14th feb they scream about sanskaar and roam around in bikes like a 2 take ka Valentino Rossi. 

Conservatism is cancer. Patriarchy is it's brightest symptom.;Saza sirf gareebon ko hoti hai, Ameeron ko toh insaf milta hai.

People like Senger and Chinmayanand will never be hanged. They will not even be behind bars for long. That's how this country works.;To everyone saying deterrence and severity of punishment, how many people have started wearing helmets and following traffic rules since the challan amount was raised? 
And how many people wore helmets and followed rules when the police actually started to enforce the law much more vigilantly? 
And is severity really the deterrent or the certainty of punishment?;Yay!;Now if some big rich personal does similar crime, he will surely be looking for that defence lawyer who has been fighting against this case.

Your spinal cord snaps, you become unconscious and your body stops functioning. All this happens roughly within a couple of minutes. That's it. 

The amount of pain, suffering and trauma that a rapist inflicts upon their victim and their family is something that doesn't go away for even years. It keeps following you around where ever go. Always lingering in the background. And of course then there's society to further deepen the wound.

That degree of suffering, that feeling of helplessness and hopelessness, is nothing in front of simple hanging.;Wait, wasn't one of those guys killed or he committed suicide or something?;Oh boy, I'm gonna get a lot of shit for this, but I'm against the death penalty, we acted like animals frothing at the mouths screaming for these cunts to be hanged. Life without parole? Yes 100% for these monsters, but seeing everyone say she finally got justice is just wrong on so many levels. That's what made the girls story so sad and so tragic, she will never get justice for what they did to her; you enjoying hanging these four monsters is not fucking justice for her. Medieval-esque mobocracy.;“I will mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy. Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”

— Jessica Dovey

A loss of life is nothing to rejoice about, even if it was so called 'justice'. That the whole crime occurred and this needed to be done is an unfortunate event and we need to reflect on what issues in our society existed that lead to this crime and what needs to be done to solve them.;Everyone knew they were the culprits and yet it took the judiciary 8 years to hang them.

The question becomes, what is the relevance of being a female athlete when gender is fluid. Can we allow a very effeminate man who identifies as a woman to compete in women’s sports?

Recently there was some news about how top World Cup female soccer teams had been dominated by third tier men’s teams. This is another aspect of the absurdity. If women are insulated from competition from males, because males have unfair levels of testosterone, then shouldn’t they also be insulated from other individuals who have high testosterone regardless of those individual’s self declared gender identification?

प्रेमचंद का एक चित्र मेरे सामने है, पत्नी के साथ फोटो खिंचा रहे हैं। सिर पर किसी मोटे कपड़े की टोपी, कुरता और धोती पहने हैं। कनपटी चिपकी है, गालों की हड्डियाँ उभर आई हैं, पर घनी मूँछें चेहरे को भरा-भरा बतलाती हैं।

पाँवों में केनवस के जूते हैं, जिनके बंद बेतरतीब बँधे हैं। लापरवाही से उपयोग करने पर बंद के सिरों पर की लोहे की पतरी निकल जाती है और छेदों में बंद डालने में परेशानी होती है। तब बंद कैसे भी कस लिए जाते हैं।

दाहिने पाँव का जूता ठीक है, मगर बाएँ जूते में बड़ा छेद हो गया है जिसमें से अँगुली बाहर निकल आई है।
   

  मेरी दृष्टि इस जूते पर अटक गई है। सोचता हूँ—फोटो खिंचवाने की अगर यह पोशाक है, तो पहनने की कैसी होगी? नहीं, इस आदमी की अलग-अलग पोशाकें नहीं होंगी—इसमें पोशाकें बदलने का गुण नहीं है। यह जैसा है, वैसा ही फोटो में खिंच जाता है।

मैं चेहरे की तरफ़ देखता हूँ। क्या तुम्हें मालूम है, मेरे साहित्यिक पुरखे कि तुम्हारा जूता फट गया है और अँगुली बाहर दिख रही है? क्या तुम्हें इसका ज़रा भी अहसास नहीं है? ज़रा लज्जा, संकोच या झेंप नहीं है? क्या तुम इतना भी नहीं जानते कि धोती को थोड़ा नीचे खींच लेने से अँगुली ढक सकती है? मगर फिर भी तुम्हारे चेहरे पर बड़ी बेपरवाही, बड़ा विश्वास है! फोटोग्राफर ने जब ‘रेडी-प्लीज़’ कहा होगा, तब परंपरा के अनुसार तुमने मुसकान लाने की कोशिश की होगी, दर्द के गहरे कुएँ के तल में कहीं पड़ी मुसकान को धीरे-धीरे खींचकर उपर निकाल रहे होंगे कि बीच में ही ‘क्लिक’ करके फोटोग्राफर ने ‘थैंक यू’ कह दिया होगा। विचित्र है यह अधूरी मुसकान। यह मुसकान नहीं, इसमें उपहास है, व्यंग्य है!

यह कैसा आदमी है, जो खुद तो फटे जूते पहने फोटो खिचा रहा है, पर किसी पर हँस भी रहा है!

फोटो ही खिचाना था, तो ठीक जूते पहन लेते, या न खिचाते। फोटो न खिचाने से क्या बिगड़ता था। शायद पत्नी का आग्रह रहा हो और तुम, ‘अच्छा, चल भई’ कहकर बैठ गए होंगे। मगर यह कितनी बड़ी ‘ट्रेजडी’ है कि आदमी के पास फोटो खिचाने को भी जूता न हो। मैं तुम्हारी यह फोटो देखते-देखते, तुम्हारे क्लेश को अपने भीतर महसूस करके जैसे रो पड़ना चाहता हूँ, मगर तुम्हारी आँखों का यह तीखा दर्द भरा व्यंग्य मुझे एकदम रोक देता है।

तुम फोटो का महत्व नहीं समझते। समझते होते, तो किसी से फोटो खिचाने के लिए जूते माँग लेते। लोग तो माँगे के कोट से वर-दिखाई करते हैं। और माँगे की मोटर से बारात निकालते हैं। फोटो खिचाने के लिए तो बीवी तक माँग ली जाती है, तुमसे जूते ही माँगते नहीं बने! तुम फोटो का महत्व नहीं जानते। लोग तो इत्र चुपड़कर फोटो खिचाते हैं जिससे फोटो में खुशबू आ जाए! गंदे-से-गंदे आदमी की फोटो भी खुशबू देती है!

टोपी आठ आने में मिल जाती है और जूते उस ज़माने में भी पाँच रुपये से कम में क्या मिलते होंगे। जूता हमेशा टोपी से कीमती रहा है। अब तो जूते की कीमत और बढ़ गई है और एक जूते पर पचीसों टोपियाँ न्योछावर होती हैं। तुम भी जूते और टोपी के आनुपातिक मूल्य के मारे हुए थे। यह विडंबना मुझे इतनी तीव्रता से पहले कभी नहीं चुभी, जितनी आज चुभ रही है, जब मैं तुम्हारा फटा जूता देख रहा हूँ। तुम महान कथाकार, उपन्यास-सम्राट, युग-प्रवर्तक, जाने क्या-क्या कहलाते थे, मगर फोटो में भी तुम्हारा जूता फटा हुआ है!

मेरा जूता भी कोई अच्छा नहीं है। यों उपर से अच्छा दिखता है। अँगुली बाहर नहीं निकलती, पर अँगूठे के नीचे तला फट गया है। अँगूठा ज़मीन से घिसता है और पैनी मिट्टी पर कभी रगड़ खाकर लहूलुहान भी हो जाता है। पूरा तला गिर जाएगा, पूरा पंजा छिल जाएगा, मगर अँगुली बाहर नहीं दिखेगी। तुम्हारी अँगुली दिखती है, पर पाँव सुरक्षित है। मेरी अँगुली ढँकी है, पर पंजा नीचे घिस रहा है। तुम परदे का महत्त्व ही नहीं जानते, हम परदे पर कुर्बान हो रहे हैं!

तुम फटा जूता बड़े ठाठ से पहने हो! मैं ऐसे नहीं पहन सकता। फोटो तो ज़िंदगी भर इस तरह नहीं खिचाउँ, चाहे कोई जीवनी बिना फोटो के ही छाप दे।

तुम्हारी यह व्यंग्य-मुसकान मेरे हौसले पस्त कर देती है। क्या मतलब है इसका? कौन सी मुसकान है यह?

—क्या होरी का गोदान हो गया?


   

 
—क्या पूस की रात में नीलगाय हलकू का खेत चर गई?

—क्या सुजान भगत का लड़का मर गया; क्योंकि डॉक्टर क्लब छोड़कर नहीं आ सकते?

नहीं, मुझे लगता है माधो औरत के कफ़न के चंदे की शराब पी गया। वही मुसकान मालूम होती है।

मैं तुम्हारा जूता फिर देखता हूँ। कैसे फट गया यह, मेरी जनता के लेखक?

क्या बहुत चक्कर काटते रहे?

क्या बनिये के तगादे से बचने के लिए मील-दो मील का चक्कर लगाकर घर लौटते रहे?

चक्कर लगाने से जूता फटता नहीं है, घिस जाता है। कुंभनदास का जूता भी फतेहपुर सीकरी जाने-आने में घिस गया था। उसे बड़ा पछतावा हुआ। उसने कहा- ‘आवत जात पन्हैया घिस गई, बिसर गयो हरि नाम।’

और ऐसे बुलाकर देने वालों के लिए कहा था—‘जिनके देखे दुख उपजत है, तिनको करबो परै सलाम!’

चलने से जूता घिसता है, फटता नहीं। तुम्हारा जूता कैसे फट गया?

मुझे लगता है, तुम किसी सख्त चीज़ को ठोकर मारते रहे हो। कोई चीज़ जो परत-पर-परत सदियों से जम गई है, उसे शायद तुमने ठोकर मार-मारकर अपना जूता फाड़ लिया। कोई टीला जो रास्ते पर खड़ा हो गया था, उस पर तुमने अपना जूता आज़माया।

तुम उसे बचाकर, उसके बगल से भी तो निकल सकते थे। टीलों से समझौता भी तो हो जाता है। सभी नदियाँ पहाड़ थोड़े ही फोड़ती हैं, कोई रास्ता बदलकर, घूमकर भी तो चली जाती है।

तुम समझौता कर नहीं सके। क्या तुम्हारी भी वही कमज़ोरी थी, जो होरी को ले डूबी, वही ‘नेम-धरम’ वाली कमज़ोरी? ‘नेम-धरम’ उसकी भी ज़ंजीर थी। मगर तुम जिस तरह मुसकरा रहे हो, उससे लगता है कि शायद ‘नेम-धरम’ तुम्हारा बंधन नहीं था, तुम्हारी मुक्ति थी!

तुम्हारी यह पाँव की अँगुली मुझे संकेत करती-सी लगती है, जिसे तुम घृणित समझते हो, उसकी तरफ़ हाथ की नहीं, पाँव की अँगुली से इशारा करते हो?

तुम क्या उसकी तरफ़ इशारा कर रहे हो, जिसे ठोकर मारते-मारते तुमने जूता फाड़ लिया?

मैं समझता हूँ। तुम्हारी अँगुली का इशारा भी समझता हूँ और यह व्यंग्य-मुसकान भी समझता हूँ।

तुम मुझ पर या हम सभी पर हँस रहे हो, उन पर जो अँगुली छिपाए और तलुआ घिसाए चल रहे हैं, उन पर जो टीले को बरकाकर बाजू से निकल रहे हैं। तुम कह रहे हो—मैंने तो ठोकर मार-मारकर जूता फाड़ लिया, अँगुली बाहर निकल आई, पर पाँव बच रहा और मैं चलता रहा, मगर तुम अँगुली को ढाँकने की चिंता में तलुवे का नाश कर रहे हो। तुम चलोगे कैसे?

मैं समझता हूँ। मैं तुम्हारे फटे जूते की बात समझता हूँ, अँगुली का इशारा समझता हूँ, तुम्हारी व्यंग्य-मुसकान समझता हूँ;Just finished Nirmala by him a few days ago !

Harsha: No Dennis, my India isn't broken. It is full of vibrant young people doing amazing things too. We are a fully functional, mature democracy. We might voice our dissent, our disappointment at times but we are fiercely Indian. That word you used in comparison.....never.

Harsha bhogle is in denial. India was never a fully functioning democracy from the start. We have always been disfunctional. Which democracy in the world, elects a mass murderer of his own people twice and elects a terrorist to parliament. Police has committed unimaginable atrocities in UP and no cares. All institutions have become government lapdogs. And we are a vibrant and a mature democracy. Oh! Fuck off!;I'm sorry but it's a whole lot of words to basically say nothing concrete.

The budget can never ever exceed the wealth of billionaires or in fact the cumulative wealth of all citizens as well.

Budget is only the government consumption and revenue nothing else.;This is a stupid comparison.


Budget is every year. wealth is a one-time thing if you use all of it once you don't have anything next year.


I'm not saying there is huge no inequality in India. These kinds of misinformation does more harm than good.;The US budget is 3.8 trillion, while their wealth of millionaires is 4-5 trillion. Just for comparison. Can provide links/working upon request.;This is what happens when someone who doesn't understand the difference between a flow and a stock tries to be cool. Wealth is a stock, represents a quantity at that point of time and budget is a flow, measured per year.

Also what a stupid title by OP. If accumulating wealth is that easy, kamake dikhao. This country will progress when people stop ""muh rich bad"" ""capitalism izz evil"". Yes, there's high income inequality to address, but blaming the croporates/rich isn't the solution;The richest 20 billionaires in America have a combined net worth of $732 billion. That’s more than the bottom half of the American population, or 152 million people

So what's the point, there are country with even less number and more money with them.;More socialism will solve India's problems. Sure.;I can never understand nonsense like this. What do they want? A totalitarian communist state where everyone has the same money irrespective of the work they do?

Here's the deal. Human society in 2020 is structured in a way that different people perform different roles. We all influence each other and we wouldn't be able to continue without that. Therefore, our interactions are monetized in a way that people who influence more people positively, make more money.

This is a good thing. For all the shit that idealists throw at it, free market capitalism is one of the best inventions of the 20th century. And it is absolutely fair.

Communism essentially says this. You are born and you immediately deserve the same thing as everyone.

Capitalism says, you are born and you will get value, equivalent to the amount of goods and services you give to someone else.

The former may ""seem"" fair, but it isn't.

The Bajaj family for instance, has almost 10 billion in wealth. They have this because the products and services they have built, influences that many individuals. It doesn't make any sense to posit that they don't deserve that money. They didn't steal  my money. They didn't hurt anyone. They sold a lot of vehicles. 

And this is just their net worth. A lot of that is in terms of assets like buildings and factories, which actually help other individuals by providing work opportunity.

If we actually want a society where there is less disparity, we need to think about giving more people more opportunities to create products and services. We should structure our taxes in such a way that a person can be born, get an education and live a healthy, free life to be able to pursue an opportunity to make their product or service available to others. That's it. 

If we go beyond that and look at the rich as some sort of evil person stealing our rightful money, we will walk down a dangerous path. We only need to look at Russia and Venezuela to see the effects of that.;Kon hai ye chutiya op;BS;Is this some sort of a socialist joke? 🤦🏻‍♂️;typical fallacy, where you're comparing quantities that have different units.

In fact, the sentiment here is: we're spending the money equivalent to the lifetime earnings of our wealthiest class of people every single year. Where is it going, and can we improve upon it?;Bad comparison. This is stupid.;Welcome to capitalism with fewer and fewer controls. The US isn't too different in this disparity issue.;This is nature in its purest form, those billionaires worked hard for that money, India is an equal opportunity , you can be a billionaire too. If Dhirubhai ambani can So can you, so instead of complaining go work towards it.

They provide millions with jobs , they ARE the countries economy. They are one of the largest contributors to the Indian budget that you speak of. You probably work for some rich guy or plan to become one. 

This is life go work for 6 decades and become a billionaire there are so many near billionaires upcoming in the start up world who are people just like me and you.

India must be equal opportunity , some may want to spend their time becoming a billionaire some may want to spend life raising their kids and paying their home loan, Both are important.

**Its like a Fat guy hating an athlete for being better at sports. No one Stopped you from becoming one!**;Most of that billionaire money is in form of investments and assets. Only an idiot billionaire would keep all his money in form of cash because inflation will eat it away. People in this sub try to pretend as if India is a Western country with strong economy. Ground reality is a developing country like India needs investments and taxing the shit out of it will divert those funds to other countries and this will be detrimental to the poor and middle class.;Isn't the left one a balance sheet (wealth at a given point in time) and the one in right, a revenu statament (for one year, how much govt earns and spends).

Not right to compare.

Not saying equality doesn't exist;Well this is a commissioned work for Forbes India, and guess who owns Forbes India, and who is in the #1 of all the 106 billionaires, this just shows how dumb these leftists are.;Look, it is simple. Rich gets richer and poor gets poorer. It is the way of the world. You can't expect all Indians to become millionaires or billionaires.;Lol;I'm switching to BSNL;After a point in profits, it becomes nearly impossible to make more money or grow your business further without getting ""creative"". And that creativity essentially steals from thousands of people who may have made a reasonable living if the system was not rigged in favour of the super rich and powerful.

How is wealth limited in so few hands help your economy and lives?

Short answer, it does not. It actually makes your life worse because there is not enough capital to go around for the middle and lower class people to use and eventually claim.;Stop falling for these idiotic quasi-Communist ideas. Under Indira Gandhi in the 70s, the top tax rate was 97%... All we got was a race to the bottom, no innovation, no economy, only worse poverty.

And blaming the top 1% is not the solution because honestly what is their fault in this? Either they were born into this or they worked extra hard for it while the average was busy leading their average lives. Neither did they steal from the poor nor did they rob any banks (some exceptions are there, I agree). This country gives you ample opportunities which most people throw away running after needless religious and political nonsense. This country gives you enough educational opportunities but most use it to just get a job or a degree. The only reason people become IAS is because of the lack of work or under the counter earnings. The educated IAS are sitting on their asses making money they shouldn't while the country is being run by politicians most of whom are not even educated beyond 5th standard. With such a state of affairs, economy is bound to go to shit, budget is bound to take a hit and a shitstorm is bound to happen. Publishing such useless reports doesn't serve any purpose other than distracting the public from the real problems at hand.;Apples and oranges. Wealth is cumulative, budget is annual;Wealth is composed of notional and real money. Budget composes of real money.;Utopia is not possible. There will always be poor and rich people. True Equality can never be achieved.;This is not a stupid comparison.

That is why India aspires to be Socialist  we know that we cannot create equality but we are making sure that we elevate the poor to a basic standard of living and survival .We can eradicate social inequality but there will always be economical inequality.

I used to hear how the untouchables were mistreated by almost everyone. I thought why don't they just riot or fight those people mistreating them, after all they can't touch the untouchables! Later someone told me you could still touch them with sticks and stones. Damn, I was so ignorant.;I live in a semi Village locality in West Bengal,can confirm most of the household still practice untouchability. Mostly with the maids of their house.;I would like to see the correlation with percentage of 12th standard educated students. It's probably very high.

There is a reason why politicians don't like a well educated populace. Stupid people are easily manipulated into forming tribes and fighting each other.;I’m curious to know what in Kerala and Bengals history was different from the Hindi belt. I’m surprised Maharashtra is so radically different from surrounding states. You would think that the border regions would have some sort of gradient in attitudes...;Come on Cow belt. Please change.

>An extensive study by Amit Thorat teaches economics at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. Omkar Joshi is a doctoral scholar at the Department of Sociology, University of Maryland, Washington on **The caste (jati)-based practice of untouchability in India.**

>This article is based on nationally representative data of 42,152 households, surveyed in 2011–12, which, for the first time, asked direct questions on caste and the practice of untouchability. This data is part of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), a panel survey conducted in 2004–05 and 2011–12, which is a joint undertaking of the National Council of Applied Economic Researchand the University of Maryland.

>The household schedule of the 2011–12 IHDS posed the following question to the primary respondent of each of the enumerated survey households: “Do some members practise untouchability in your household?” The respondent’s answer was recorded as a “Yes/No” response. In case the response was a “No,” it was followed by the second question: “Would there be a problem if someone who is a Scheduled Caste were to enter your kitchen or share utensils?,” again seeking a “Yes/No” response. Any household that responded in the affirmative to both or either of the two questions was regarded as practising untouchability.

Economically sound hai to reservation ki kya zaroorat
Padha Likha hai , reservation ki vajah se isko Kuch Nahi AATA Hoga
Kaam ekdum (insert lower caste name) Jaise

I still remember when we lived in UP ,the house maid found out that we are dalit ,she left the work next day and same day we were asked to vacate the house. When we vacated the house my dad told me the landlords cleaned the whole house with Ganges water. Word got out and my family was socially ostracized , suddenly friends stoped talking to me. teachers called me with casteist slurs.
It was a living nightmare we had to leave the city

Now I still have to lie about my caste everywhere I go ,they all act progressive but in reality they are the backward ones

The most hilarious thing is people are ready to drink cow urine but won't touch food made by an untouchable;Kerala of 1800s and early 1900s were extremely casteist, probably one of the worst in the country even. I haven't heard of practices like [breast tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Tax) happening anywhere else other than Kerala. It's amazing how much we progressed in the last 60-70 years. Still, caste is not going anywhere, even in Kerala. It has gone more covert though. What I've noticed is that, many people from outside Kerala starts to probe about one's caste openly the moment you meet them. I've never experienced such things while I lived in Kerala.;Unsurprisingly, it correlates with high GDP per capita and better HDI.;I'm from M.P. and sc caste and i have seen people making bad/weird faces when knowing my last name. And i have seen my classmates discriminating sc/st people on the basis of reservation (""iska kya hai ye to bina padhe likhe bhi reservation se pass ho jayega/jayegi);The south seems to be far better.;Interesting fact: Majority of the Hindu immigrants/refugees who will benefit from CAA are Dalits from Bangladesh, now living in Assam and West Bengal. BJP is a bit [two-faced](https://thewire.in/caste/the-two-faces-of-hindutvas-dalit-agenda) when it comes to Dalits.;My district in Assam has close to 0%,feels good. I guess it correlates with education,we have the highest/2nd highest literacy rate in the State.;How do they get this data? I am not questioning the validity of data. But I don't think they went house 2 house asking if people practice untouchability.;These are depressing statistics;Wtf whats up with some parts of himachal and uttrakhand? Thought my states didnt had it this bad.;Nice to see my home state doing good-ish here. Still 5% is 5% too much. Shit needs to stop.;I am noticing a pattern when it comes to every major problem in India.;Way to go --- dont forget your Northeast Indians --- they have put aside these old beliefs --- Hindi heartland could learn a thing or two.

One observation is the long-time communist run states like Kerala and W.Bengal and the emphasis on education --- most commendable for Kerala given what its historic caste structure and history of oppression has been, even W.Bengal with the oppressive Zamindari history.

Maharashtra is interesting --- there is a common Marathi identity greater than other identifiers, possibly also the higher penchant for industry and economics.

Just my 2 paise trying to understand how this can be explained.;No more claiming of North is Progressive and South is Conservative!  
Being conservative is good if you are Progressive within.;In the context of this study, how are ""households practising untouchability"" defined? I was trying to see what it was from the link to the IHDS-II data, but I'm not savvy enough to figure it out.

In any case, I'm pleasantly surprised that Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala, and quite a few places in the North-East (except for the ones with no data) appear to have massively reduced the practice of untouchability in their regions.;My state WB seem to do pretty well . If the data is right and good sample size is considered I'm aure it'll be even better.;Maharashtra Kerala and Bengal along with the far Eastern frontier states seems considerably exceptional. Pretty predictable. But did no Jyotiba Phule or Rammohan Roy or Vidyasagar emerge in these northern states? I mean, damn look at the amount of red... pretty depressing for India as a whole...;Source: [https://ihds.umd.edu/sites/ihds.umd.edu/files/publications/papers/ThoratJoshi3.pdf](https://ihds.umd.edu/sites/ihds.umd.edu/files/publications/papers/ThoratJoshi3.pdf);In case anyone wants to learn more, the documentary India Untouched offers a deeper look into untouchability and the way it's practiced in different parts of the country. Really informative and insightful.;Again, not surprising that the places also map out with [where the BJP won](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election#/media/File%3AIndian_General_Election_2019.svg). South India is far more progressive, clearly.;I love how the colour for 0% and no data is the same.   
TN's scenario isn't as bad as I thought. Still pretty bad considering it looks more like a north Indian state than a south Indian state from this map.;Its funny that people are supporting CAA and NRC to give prosecuted minorities from neighboring countries citizenship while there are far more minorities inside the country who face discrimination and what not on a daily basis but no one cares for their pain.
Makes me wonder if the CAA and NRC is just a political stunt for vote bank or the govt really cares about the minorities.;And mainland Indians have the audacity to think that the Eastern states are junglee and un-civillised. 


Completely fed up of this bigotry.;How has no one mentioned Bengal, as clean(no red spots) as Maharashtra if not more. The reforms that started here spread to the villages with the 40 year communist rule instilling the values into deeper sections of society and peripheral villages too. I'm not a proponent of hardcore communism, but I feel it has had it's share of good effects amongst the many bad ones.;As a North Easterner, we have our issues but mainland cancer like dowry and caste system doesnt have a foothold. Also, people eat whatever the F they want without fear of lynching!;It is a tragedy that despite Dalits being more reformed in maharastra , they never attained political power like Dalits of UP, Bihar where Dalits have their own mainstream party.

All credit goes to Sharad pawar who ensure that Dalits never get mobilised.;This is actually not a good measure as in reality, the figures would be much higher as many practice it but deny it;Go Kerala!;I'm a malayalee mumbaikar, I didn't even know this was still a thing;One interesting thing I noticed is that even though this is a per-district depiction, the trends nearly line up cleanly according to the state borders.

This goes to show how the standardized mini-subcultures within each state influence people's values.

I've generally considered Jains to be relatively socially forward but I guess I've been living in a liberal bubble.;This is honestly very disappointing. It's 2020 now, and the practice of untouchability is still prevalent? Honestly, by now you'd thin the education system would have worked at least a little.;Growing up in MP, I lived in the decently sized city of Jabalpur. My dad was a police officer back when we were in India, and he got posted to a police station out in a village somewhere. The place was about an hour drive, so we used to go there on weekends or when we didn't feel like going to school.

This one time, during summer vacation, we were there for maybe 3 weeks. My brother and I used to go out and play in the fields or whatever all day long. This one time him, a few other friends, and I were playing around where we got our feel all covered in mud. After we were done, before we going home we decided to stop at this hand pump to wash out feet. We waited while this outer kid, around our age, was filling up about 3 matkas with water. He filled them all up, and left with 2 of them and said he'll be right back. While he was gone, I decided to wash my feet (his 3rd matka was out of the way). He comes back, see's me washing my feel, and gets pissed the fuck off. He doesn't say anything to me (since my father was the police incharge of the area), but he did say something to one of our friends in a Hindi dielect I didn't understand and then he threw out all the water from the matka. Confused, I asked my friend what was going on? He said this guys is from some higher caste, and they don't drink or eat anything that has come into contact with someone from a lower cast. I said I'm not even Hindu, I'm Sikh. He said since he doesn't know your caste, he's treating you as a lower caste and will refill the water.

That's when I realized shit like untouchability and caste system is still alive and well in India.;An obvious and visible form of untouchability would be less harmful than invisible form where higher casts do not show they are treating lower cast people in an inferior manner but just not include  them in daily activities.;Pleasantly surprised seeing Maharashtra stand alone seeing surrounded by a sea of red.

Also surprised it's not all white in Kerala. Have heard of pockets in Kasargod area that drops into Karnataka. Work needs to be done.

Extremely shocked seeing TN though."

(Source: Twitter)

A policeman’s job in India is not an easy one. And though the police force is there to protect and help the citizens of this country – and they do so as well – there are times when they find themselves in a fix when dealing with VIPs. How many times have we seen policemen and women being hauled up for not giving preferential treatment to a bureaucrat or politician and the incident being caught on camera. Well, such problems don’t stop these lawmen from doing their duty, and one such example was of a Bengaluru traffic police officer, who stopped the President’s convoy so that an ambulance could pass through.

Traffic police sub-inspector ML Nijalingappa, who was deployed at Bengaluru’s Trinity Circle on Saturday (June 17), has won hearts in the city and on social media alike for making way for an ambulance even as a convoy of the President of India was to pass through a busy junction. According to an ANI report, the Bengaluru Police later announced a reward for the policeman for making way for an ambulance during the convoy movement of President Pranab Mukherjee, who was in the city for the inauguration of Metro’s Green Line.

Mukherjee’s convoy was headed towards the Raj Bhavan when Nijalingappa is said to have spotted an ambulance trying to make its a way towards a private hospital near HAL. The sub-inspector directed his colleagues to help the ambulance travel through the traffic-heavy road.

Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic East Division, Bengaluru City, Abhei Goyal later took to Twitter to praise the officer’s presence of mind.

PSI Sh Nijlingappa is rewarded for deftly allowing the ambulance before the 1st citizen of India. @blrcitytraffic gives way to ??, do you? pic.twitter.com/KoI2nap14N — DCP Traffic East (@DCPTrEastBCP) June 18, 2017

Praveen Sood, the Commissioner of Police, tweeted, “The policeman who took such initiative to be rewarded. Well done!”

Twitter has been buzzing with reactions to the news, with some saying that what the officer did was to be expected and should not be hailed as an achievement, while others lauded the policeman’s decision.

Glad to hear but giving an ambulance priority over politicians is a basic expectation not an achievement. — M (@MBR_29) June 17, 2017

in theory yes….but in the Indian context this is HUGE decision for a policeman to make…must be recognized and encouraged. — Sarat Shanmukh (@SaratShanmukh) June 18, 2017

And also, I tend to be one of the lucky guys in India who lives with his girlfriend. But also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in Delhi.

Here's a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited

* Initially I had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my ""Living arrangement"" and how ""apposit Jendaars"" are not supposed to live together.

* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about it. He's cool like that.)

* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.

* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.

* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???

* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I've murdered their children.

* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) 

* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready

* Honb'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.

* Another honb'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can't drink.*  
As if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.

And I am 24 btw. Just for perspective for how ridiculous they are.

Also my mom told me last night that she got a call from everyone saying  ""*Ladka bohot open ho gaya hai. Iski shaadi karado.*""",My relatives visited me. And I live with my girlfriend unbeknownst to them. And they lost their shit. And it was a thing of beauty.

And that was pure gold for me.;Well your relatives won't bother you anymore.
You completely crushed their impression of you.

   But if people waited around for all parties to understand before fighting for themselves, we’d still be a British Colony. ;>""*Ladka bohot open ho gaya hai. Iski shaadi karado.*""

This cracked me up. I hope your mum didn't take them seriously! ;I feel jealous frankly. ;I read all the comments, I feel that there should be alternate perspective to it 


1. Live-in is not new to Indian culture, it is an age old practice classic example is Gandharva Vivah wherein you accept in your heart your soulmate without any rituals. Being open & forth coming is a good thing, rather than living in guilt. Kudos to parents to accept that.


2. I feel that regressive ideas should at most be ignored from people above 50+. I am 35 & I feel a bit regressive when I interact with my cousins in 20s. I also see same phenomenon with my friends. Regressive thinking sets in simply because you don't pace up with changing times. Kids born before 1990s should understand that phase was about survival, with liberalized economy it is about expression. You guys would laugh, but let me tell you there use to be 5+ yrs waiting time to buy anything like scooter, telephone, gas connection etc. Understand what struggle it would have been in those days. We interact with people of our age, go to places which we visited since our 20s & go through similar struggles in our life. It takes a while for all of us to come to terms with the world that is beyond our's. Simple example I can give is, in our teens b'day party use to be 1 samosa & thumbs up ( Coke was locked up behind socialist India) now compare with b'day parties of today's teen. It takes time to come to terms with changes around us. Some of my friends chose to ignore reality & sank more into regression, some of us came out of it & rest are in limbo. Same would happen to you after 25 years, what is trendy today would be regressive in future. 


3. My father use to scold people in my village who use to ridicule mentally retarded ( near retarded) folks in village. He use to say that they should lend support to such people rather than ridiculing them. Same goes with people with regressive mindset. Don't ridicule them, try to bring them to terms with reality. ;*Ladka bhot open minded ho gya h, isko conservative bnao*;>Ladka bohot open ho gaya hai. Iski shaadi karado

Best thing I've read in a while;This reminds me of a similar incident in my life. 

I was dating A. She lived in a different flat in the same apartment complex. A colleague of mine, B came to my city and I needed a roomie so I offered her my place which B gladly accepted. I didn't wanna keep this hidden from my mom so I told her all about it. She was very skeptical but stopped short of telling me I can't do it. My gf at the time, A, was fine with it because she would be over at my place half the time any way and she knew B. 

Few months later, A decided to move in with me and B. Splitting the rent 3 ways so we can save more :P
I hesitatingly tell my mom about this as well. That there are now 2 girls living with me. She said she was relieved. I'm like....""Wait what???"" 

Mom said that now that there are more than 2 people in the house, nothing untoward can happen between me and anyone else. So in other words, now that my gf moved in with me, mommy things no sexiness will happen in the house between any 2 people.

She still doesn't speak to me, and yeah she did end up ratting to my father(who is an engineer btw) and he was like yeah i already know its nothing serious lmao she just hates my guts now;Man kudos to you .

So this in itself is a major win 🤘.;You are making a lot of people really envious here. ;You deserve the Gold, here have it.;Atleast your relatives get offended over things like this.

This is the same police who didn't let my dad buy my medicine after my operation when medical stores were open of passes. This is still the same police who collects ""hafta"" from 4 lottery stalls where i catch my college bus from. And this is the same police who senselessly beat Ali Mangat in police custody and threaten him to get him raped.

India is proud of You Indian Football Captain Sunil Chhetri.;Serious question- I'm an Indian living in the States. I want to support the Indian football team. I have a kid who is about to turn two, and I don't want to fall into the easy cricket fandom that's so accessible to expatriates. We don't have a tv or cable connection by choice. Does r/India have any suggestions?;What's the world record? ;No, Sunil Chhetri is not a Messi or a Ronaldo. He played against much weaker opponents. However, we should also remember he didn't get the quality training or guidance like them in India. There's also not much money in playing football in India. Chhetri's networth is only about $1 million while Messi's $340 million and Ronaldo's $400 million. 

In spite of all that he is in the elite list of highest international goal scorers ever. It was not an easy milestone because no Indian player couldn't score more than 20 international goals before him. So all praise to him. Also, we should remember that we need Sunil Chhetris to prepare the ground for the future Messi from India.;He is an amazing Footballer.

Guys, if this video even remotely made you curious about Indian football do join us on r/IndianFootball, we would love to interact with you and discuss the game.

Mumbaikars over here, if possible try to attend the game on 4th June vs Kenya. Trust me it will be a good experience. We are on form after scoring 5 past Taiwan (check out these goals [5-0](https://streamable.com/4c8d0), [4-0](https://streamable.com/cwhpq), [3-0](https://streamable.com/z3e9u)) and Kenya are a tough team, it will be a good result if we can win tomorrow. 

Now let's go through the usual excuses that will stop you from going to the game.

**The timings are weird:** No they are not, the kick off is at 8:00 PM, after office hours for most.

**The stadium is far:** Mumbai Football Arena, Andheri. It is right next to the Azad Nagar Metro Station.

**It's raining:** Well most of the stands at the stadium are covered, so no worries there.

**Where to get tickets/ tickets are expensive:** Buy them from [Bookmyshow](https://in.bookmyshow.com/sports/football/intercontinental-cup-tournament/india-vs-kenya/seat-layout/aerialview/ET00075919/SRCX/10023). Tickets are 250 and 500. I leave it to your judgement to decide if that is expensive. 

Need another reason. Tomorrow **Chhetri will get his 100th Cap for the National Team**, all the more reason to see the team in action live.;This is what happens when you host matches in cities where the Indian national team has less fan following.Why not host these international matches in Kolkata , Kochi, Guwahati or even Aizawl or Bengaluru . ;Really hope one day India will play the FIFA World Cup ;Even my friends who love football don't go to these matches. 

Indian football has no audience. ;This is heartbreaking. Coming at a time when our team is getting great resuluts, i hope this appeal results in a larger crowd;I did go for the match against Chinese Taipei. It was an awesome experience. Would really recommend anyone who is in Mumbai to go for it. You wouldn't regret it. ;That single refusal to play in a world cup has cost us dearly down the line. The biggest problem behind our terrible relationship with football is not corruption ( if that was the case then Nigeria, Ivory coast and Cameroon wouldn't pump out the kind of players they actually do) or lack of training facilities but a lack of understanding towards footballing as a career and the absence of grassroots level effort to make it popular among our citizens.;Nope. We are just selective football fans happy with our Uniteds, Arsenals and Madrids of the world.

If we go by attendance, then the U-17 one last year was pretty successful. If the United States can host a World Cup, I think India can in the 2030s at least.

Other than that, I don't see any reason we could qualify for the World Cup by then.

Like a Messi or a George Best. This will spark the imagination of the younger generation. And the crowds will come, not because Sunil Chhetri or someone pleaded them to come, but because they 'wanted' to come.

Be patient. There is someone like this somewhere amongst our billion and I believe Indian Football will find these players. As of now, Indian Football is just not relatively as entertaining as some other more obvious options, for an average viewer, that is. ;True, a lot of my friends are football fans but not a single one of them watches Indian football. They always go on and on anoint Manchester, Liverpool, Barcelona, and other teams. But when it comes to supporting national team they nope out of their as fast as possible.

The audience would automatically improve.;Sorry for Sunil, but condition is not going to improve any time soon. We need a spark to follow Indian football, see wrestling or batminton these sport have great following now, at least Indian football team should qualify to second round of qualifications regrading world cup and be top 12 teams in Asia. That time people will really go and watch.;I'm sorry monsieur, I won't be able to attend the match.
But will surely cheer for you on TV.;Abuse us, Criticize us. Destiny still arrives.;Tomorrow's match is at 8PM at the Andheri Sports Complex in Mumbai. Those who can make it, please do.

A game that takes all of 90 minutes, compared to the so\-called 'international' game of cricket which takes way more time.  I grew up watching Indian football and playing the game too, there is no better sport. I've played in an adult league too.  I think it sucks that people pay up to watch Cricket only, and nothing else \(hockey too is untouchable except when they shine\).  Just goes to show, that certain kinds of thinking are deeply etched in people's brains, like hard\-wired.

Cricket is fit only for TV. Soccer on the other hand, works for both stadium, and TV.  Soccer also has this thing : even a school boy or college game can be fun to watch , in a stadium.  With a cricket game in a stadium \(with no replays, no big TV screens\) \- its a hit or miss game \- meaning visibility just isn't there \- with that small ball \- totally say goodbye to visibility with a red\-ball.

The  \*only soccer\* that most Indians insist on watching is when the cricketers warm up.

Even when they watch soccer, these people have very high standards  : the lineup has got to have a Messi, or a Ronaldo or some hero at that level \- anything below that is below their fucking standard.;It is a circle. People will watch what interests them, sports improve because of the support it receives.

However, you can't force people to support what does not interests them. You have chosen a career that's a hobby for many, because they have chosen a regular path to feed their family.;I'm a cricket fan primarily and support RCB and India religiously being from bng. Last year at a point when no cricket was on I had to pass my time so I just casually went through the sports channel , the EPL was going on ( I hadn't watched much football previously ) . It was Tottenham Hotspurs vs arsenal and my interest was sparked. I chose to support the spurs as they were more of the underdogs who punched above their weight and made it a point to follow all their games and now I'm a big spurs fan . 

So I decided to start supporting BFC too but after watching the EPL and level of play the isl quality paled in comparison. The commentary, the atmosphere and the feel of the stadium everything . So I can understand why people would choose the EPL and la liga over the ISL.

However the least we could do is support team INDIA if not our local ISL clubs because without support from the public there won't be much growth . ;The standard of Indian football is very low and until and unless they qualified for world cup (which will be a miracle) its popularity will not gain momentum. Even the country of only few lakhs like iceland qualified for world cup which is a shame for Billion nation!!;Quality brings crowd. ;Ain't nobody got time for that.
On a serious note all you got to do is win something big and people will be all over you.;Lol, why would someone spend money to watch football?;Cringe. Borderline emotional blackmail. Get out of a field which doesn't get you audience/money/career/whatever. Indians don't like football. It's cricket all the way through. What you gonna do about it? Every country has such one obsession. And besides, what about other sports? Which one should we pick? What about other professions? You can't get literally beg for views or audience like this; it is cringeworthy. He gave two reasons to come and watch. 1. Football is the best game in the world. 2. He is playing for his country.

Now to make football a popular sport in the country we should promote the game in the grassroot level first rather than just creating ads which force people to be a fan of the game.;Kinda miss Robin Singh on both football and cricket now ;All we need is to stand with them as we did with our cricket team make them A STAR too like cricket players.

Go ahead, downvote me :);It was the Left that carried out these attacks. I'm convinced of it. It's not going to be long before motaman pulls the mask from their faces and humiliates the entire national Left and the anti-CAA movement in one masterstroke.

I only look forward to when our gen become parents and teach our children not to litter.

Education doesn't help in such scenarios mate.;Similar problem at my friend's colony too. 
He wrote a 5-6 page letter (that included description of the content of the garbage  and it's smell, mosquito breeding and other insects/animal nuisance due to that garbage,  how to dispose organic/ inorganic waste, responsibility of residents as citizen of India and municipality services). He distributed photocopies to each and every house (he went to each and every house personally and gave a mini lecture) also sent the same to municipality.
The garbage problem got solved within a week.  His hard work actually paid off.;Where is this? Looks like a lot of garbage is from fruit/vegetable vendors disposing off stuff after the day's business is done.  


Funny thing about garbage is that once someone starts dumping, others think that's the designated spot and keep adding to the pile.;[This kinda thing happened ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Buddha) in Oakland in the US in front of a guy’s house so to solve it, he put a Buddha statue there and that stopped people from dumping trash there. After a while the local Vietnamese community began to look after the Buddha.

Seeing how religious most Indians are, this could work wonders in India.;I can tell you what will work. If after cleaning, someone draws images of gods there. No one will dare throw litter.

Sabka sath sabka vikas. /s;Looking at the garbage, one can tell that it's the disposal of some shop owners, and as its being disposed daily, I think it is them.


Now for the solution,
I think there is some sort of application or website to report such kind of people by uploadibg their pics.


U can go with that.;As long as Indians aren't fined stringently  they wont change for shit.;Ok, I am not saying we should throw junk on street. But want to play devil's advocate here. 

I have lived in the US and the UK. In the UK in front of my place, there used to be a set of bins placed there by the civic body. There used to be three big ones, one for recyclable, other for nonrecyclable and third I don't remember.
So all we had to do was throughout the week we used to place our junk according to the category in the bin. One one day of the week we used to move them near the road (not on the road, at the edge of the house boundary) in front of the house and that used to be taken care of.

In India, a lot of single folks stay in big cities such as Bangalore, Mumbai etc. I can't speak for Mumbai since I haven't lived there but in Bangalore usually, it is very hard to match our timing with the timing of the person that comes to collect junk. And they ask for money when it is supposed to be done freely (if I remember correctly it was 100 INR last time). 

So the easiest way out for most people is just throw it at someplace from where again the same department people have to come and collect it. Besides a lot of people who don't earn well, why on earth would they pay to 
submit the junk? So they just throw it arbitrarily.

So unless there is a systematic change, I guess it's hard to see clean roads in our country.

Edit: Formatting;Need to put dustbin there.;why is there a cat in the garbage????;This is definitely Bangalore;It is sad that the only way to stop this would be to Paint a mural of god there.;Whatever happened to waste segregation;Is there is another reason for this,usually in most countries there is a giant metal garbage container in an area where one could throw trash,the garbage trucks come and collect trash from there everyday,this way the people would know where to throw the trash.;Probably better to put the bin there instead of forcing a habit change in 100s of people? 

cuz this stuff happens when theres no where else to dump the trash and u know it'll be picked up next day.;Even our gen people are good for nothing.  When asked why you throw grabage on road, few started questioning my authority. Few simply smiled and left and few didn't even give a fuck about it. [we carried out a survey at a locality outside  chennai];Very pathetic situation..everyone need to improve on these issues 😐;Well, my dad used it open our store at 5.30 or 6am, because the municipality van comes around 8 and people dump their trash by that time.

Particularly opposite to our store on the road, where it is not a dump place. He would sit in our shop and used to ask to throw it in the nearby dumpster and if someone threw it already, he would ask them to pick it up or a simple warning ""police"" would do the trick. 

He did for a week time, until 99% stopped doing it and the rest stopped as well.;Where else is trash supposed to be thrown? This is not sarcasm. What is a designated receptacle in that area?  


\>spot is absolutely cleaned by the garbage collection guys only to be again dumped with garbage by the end of the night. 

That sounds like any kind of trash collection anywhere else in this world (may happen at different times of the day though). That is pretty much the point of trash collection.  


If you're looking for a place with an antiquated trash collection system, where trash is removed from the street only to pile on again, you only need to look so far as New York City. Hell, in the summer you can actually smell the warm trash fuming with all sorts of smells, and in the winter, trash mixes with the snow and floats in big puddles that you need to jump over. The only thing I don't see here is giant trash bags made of leak-proof plastic that won't decompose in a million years.   


Looks pretty normal to me.;Strange. This is directly in contradiction to what the [Ugly Indian claimed](https://youtu.be/tf1VA5jqmRo).

EDIT: Ok, I thought a bit more and remembered that the Ugly Indian, at one point, points out that cleaning the place is not enough- you also need to get to the underlying problem. In such cases, you have to put in a bit more effort and decorate the place so that it looks better than ever before for it to really work, otherwise Indians would just start dumping/pissing/shitting/spitting there again.;Indian are most irresponsible, self centred, and lazy People with lack of basic awareness towards community sanitation;The funny/sad thing is, if the department places a huge bin over here, it'll get stolen or something...;You should draw a gods portrait on the floor with permanent paint.;I have worked in India for few years. I have seen people of all age groups throwing garbage on streets. Given how price sensitive indians are, I believe a fine will act as a huge detterent (I believe similar thing happened in Singapore). But given corruption is part of DNA in India sadly I don't see that happening anytime soon.;and how ironic the ppl who clean it we call them kachrawala ........when will human learn to dispose garbage in a proper manner.;They should paint that road with photo of a God.;Even in European countries during the weekly markets the farmers dump their trash in the market only to be picked up by the municipality. These hawkers pay taxes to the authorities and the trash is not their concern but its of the authorities to clear it after the market is closed.

You can see garbage everywhere. When it rains... it's a habitat of all sorts of communicable diseases.;In my place it is totally different even two big dustbin is not enough for a day. All the garbage will be on the road since the dustbins will be full;I am not Indian but love India and have traveled there five times. I must say the rubbish is absolutely the most depressing thing about the country. 

Beautiful beaches are totally ruined with rubbish that people throw. I've seen public bins surrounded by rubbish, none of it in the bin. Rubbish filling up most streets and drainage channels on the roads. Everyone does it and nobody cares.

It really hit home on my most recent visit which was coming to Kochi in Kerala via Sri Lanka - and SL was so clean by comparison (but not perfect). I went from lovely beaches in SL you could enjoy and swim at to Fort Kochi Beach which was covered in rubbish and stray dogs. One tourist was determined to enjoy it anyway and had made a little circle for himself to sit amongst the rubbish. It was so sad.

You have a beautiful country and people are ruining it.;Is there a garbage dump nearby?;Proper education about recycling and disposing waste need to be provided in schools, offices, societies, etc. We need stricter laws and rigid fines to be administered for littering. Once or twice every year I see some influencer cleaning up Juhu beach (one of the many examples) successfully and posting before and after posts. Of course, clean up drives are great but it is only a short term solution.  The fact is that no one is taking up the responsibility of a long term change. No one is scared of the laws because there’s always a way to get out of the situation using bribes, “contacts”, aggression. There is no respect for the law in our country. Which is why when you meet Indians travelling abroad you’ll almost never see them littering or breaking traffic rules because they know that there will be monetary consequences. In India, there won’t.;This is a common scenario is every city of India. People tend to blame everything on the government but it's always the general people at fault.;This is so bad and displays the mentality of the people. Not only don't they have the common sense of not throwing garbage in open like that, but it also shows how disrespectful they are of others. The garbage collector's are there to collect the garbage disposal bags, they are not there to collect raw garbage from the ground and then take it all away. Have some respect for the person who is coming and cleaning your neighborhood, his job is something that you would find disgusting or probably look down upon, but if he doesn't come to work for even two days, your life is going to become hell. So atleast put your garbage in the disposal bag and tie it up, so the garbage collectors can do their job effectively, it's a small thing that goes a long way.;Never;Chutiyon ki koi kami Nahin hai;That's the mistake garbage collection guys do. They should just let it all pile up there. Let those citizens enjoy that sight. That's the only way to teach these irresponsible Indians some sense.;Cleanliness begins with us. If we don't take the efforts to keep our premises clean, our govt won't give a shit either. It's like an endless cycle.

I just felt comfortable knowing he was around, motivating people, kind of like a grandpa uncle u always thought will be forever there for you. 

I feel sad. Fuck ! ;Based on True Story!

There were about 70 scientists working on a very hectic project. All of them were really frustrated due to the pressure of work and the demands of their boss but everyone was loyal to him and did not think of quitting the job. 

One day, one scientist came to his boss and told him – Sir, I have promised to my children that I will take them to the exhibition going on in our township. So I want to leave the office at 5 30 pm. His boss replied “OK, You’re permitted to leave the office early today”. The Scientist started working. He continued his work after lunch. As usual he got involved to such an extent that he looked at his watch when he felt he was close to completion. The time was 8.30 PM. 

Suddenly he remembered of the promise he had given to his children. He looked for his boss, He was not there. Having told him in the morning itself, he closed everything and left for home. Deep within himself, he was feeling guilty for having disappointed his children. He reached home. Children were not there. His wife alone was sitting in the hall and reading magazines. The situation was explosive, any talk would boomerang on him. His wife asked him “Would you like to have coffee or shall I straight away serve dinner if you are hungry."" The man replied “If you would like to have coffee, I
too will have but what about Children ??” .Wife replied “You don’t know?? , Your manager came here at 5.15 PM and has taken the children to the exhibition “.

What had really happened was …. The boss who granted him permission was observing him working seriously at 5.00 PM. He thought to himself, this person will not leave the work, but if he has
promised his children they should enjoy the visit to exhibition. So he took the lead in taking them to exhibition. The boss does not have to do it every time but once it is done, loyalty is established. That is why all the scientists at Thumba continued to work under their boss even though the stress was tremendous.

By the way, can you guess who the boss was ?

Dr A.P.J Abdul Kalam:Greatest Indian President,Missile Man Of India and The Ultimate Youth Icon;Cried at my desk, when I heard this news. I don't know if there exist a single other person whom I would cry for, and who doesn't know me even. 

I never thought he would die. Always wanted to do something great, great enough to merit a meeting with him in person. Although, he has deprived me of the chance of meeting him, yet he has inspired me to do something worthwhile. 

Never has India seen a figure who brought all the masses together. Loved by all sects/casts/religions/social strata, IDK if there was ever a loss bigger than this for India. 

Hope that the government creates a memorial for him, just as they have done for the likes of Gandhi. 
;I am feeling sad, I never thought I would feel so for a President, but he was so much more than that Scientist, Educationist, Author. He did so much for our country.
Rest In Peace.;[deleted];Rest in Peace you absolute gem. Rarely do we see such simple, humble and singularly dedicated people in the Indian public sphere. He was an institution and an inspiration to many.

The first time I got to know him was when he was the chief advisor to the Raksha Mantri. He would turn up to our DRDO campus' new year's eve celebrations and sit with all us kids and talk to us. I had the honour of meeting him a few times during his visits to dad's lab. In 2004 when some of us won the Sankalp Science prize he invited all of us to the Rashtrapati Bhavan for tea spontaneously! I still have those photos and they will be treasured. The last time I met him was probably in '07 or '08 when after visiting dad's lab he stopped by ours for some Upma and filter coffee! To the very end he was a simple man...one cot, one table and chair and cassettes of carnatic music. He loved the veena and was a huge fan of MS Subbalakshmi. 

Thanks for everything APJ. Farewell.

RIP Missile Man of India;[deleted];Your candle burnt out long before your legend ever will;10 quotes by APJ

1. You have to dream before your dreams can come true.

2. Excellence is a continuous process and not an accident.

3. Life is a difficult game. You can win it only by retaining your birthright to be a person.

4. Man needs his difficulties because they are necessary to enjoy success.

5. We will be remembered only if we give to our younger generation a prosperous and safe India, resulting out of economic prosperity coupled with civilizational heritage.

6. Those who cannot work with their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted success that breeds bitterness all around.

7. Educationists should build the capacities of the spirit of inquiry, creativity, entrepreneurial and moral leadership among students and become their role model.

8. Look at the sky. We are not alone. The whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work.

9. If a country is to be corruption free and become a nation of beautiful minds, I strongly feel there are three key societal members who can make a difference. They are the father, the mother and the teacher.

10. My message, especially to young people is to have courage to think differently, courage to invent, to travel the unexplored path, courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and succeed. These are great qualities that they must work towards. This is my message to the young people.

Better late to the party than never.;Some of the comments here are castigating her saying this is for publicity and PR stunt. This is why they stay silent and just avoid taking stands. Because it's a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation. If they don't say anything then people are on their backs saying why aren't they speaking up. Why aren't they saying anything, they can influence people they have the power to, and when they do then the right wing will obviously troll them, and then they have to contend with ""oh is there a movie coming out?"" ""Publicity stunt"" ""PR move"" or just the ""doing it for attention"". So what exactly do they do? They take the safest way out and just shut up. 

What people aren't seeing is that this time, all the celebrities that matter stayed away or snubbed that dinner that the govt organized. Whatever their reasoning, they stayed away. That in itself is a big slap on their face. After that, Yesterday at the Bandra and Gateway protests there were celebrities present. And now we have Deepika coming out openly and supporting those at JNU. This is in their own little way a big FU to the govt. And the fact that they are openly showing their support to the protests is a big deal. Because they do have a lot at stake. Like it or not.;Pretty unprecedented for Ms. Padukone. Hopefully this silences the outcry for her support since the terrorists who attacked JNU carried acid in ""defence"".;Risking her movie career to stand in solidarity with the truth. 🙏;This makes it even bigger bravery when you realize that the releasing movie is produced by herself.;More and More power to Deepika...;Tajinder Pal Bagga has already [started calling](https://twitter.com/TajinderBagga/status/1214561442357080070?s=19) for a Boycott of her film Chapaak.;Haven't watched a bollywood movie in years.

Bearing the blunder after what she's done is going to be heavy no matter what, but she did nevertheless. Very brave of her to finally take a stand and care.

No matter what their background or foreground is we shouldn't be critical about any person joining the protest. They have the right to.

We should appreciate them and call for more. 

It's all about India vs Bhakterea. We need the Antibiotic of Unity.;Immense respect to her. With a high stake movie to be released very soon, she's boldly expressing her views.;Thanks for taking a stand.;https://i.imgur.com/ZysWMp8.jpg;Genuine act of her, considering she only visited there as a protester and said nothing that can cause any controversy.;please  watch her movie. Bhakt started boycott Chappak on Twitter. We don't want to send msg that if opposed they will face backlash on their movie. 

More power to her, it takes guts to arrive before your movie release, most take the neutral road to ensure the ticket purchases aren’t impacted by either of the sides. But here we have DP on the right side of history, fighting for the country.;For everyone calling it a publicity stunt, she could have gone to a pro caa rally too, that would have also become news. 
The fact that a celebrity with her reach chose to take such a bold move and show open support is commendable, regardless of her intentions;She has made her stance clear! Very brave! This kind of encouragement of use of personal liberties is what is needed , don't step on hers! 

Doesn't matter if any of her damn movie is releasing or not;Its very supportive of her to come out with JNU students very much appreciated and thanks for giving a slapping answer to the people carrying acid inside college for safety. 

She did this movie on acid attack, one can only understand what she must have felt when she knew acid was carried inside to be thrown on girls from hostel.

Support her and everyone who stands with us at these times or there wont be us anymore it would be just you and me.;PR stunt or not it really doesnt matter. whatever her reasons are one thing is for sure,she has some fucking huge balls.;I think one reason most popular actors stay away from taking a political stand on issues like these is perhaps because they are contractually obliged to do so. Remember what happened to SRK and Aamir when they aired their views.

If I were a producer, I would get my actors to sign a contract that they would do nothing that would jeopardize the sale of my movie's tickets. Of course Modi bootlickers are gonna bootlick because that doesn't seem to be affecting ticket sales. But the day people start taking offense to people like Akshay Kumar being pro-BJP, that is the day even he will be violating his contract and be asked not to do so.;I would have to assume that the allegations that ABVP brought acid for the attack must have had some effect.   


I know i was shocked. You can't be cavalier about something like acid. Wounds heal. Acid injury is forever.;To those going “this is a PR stunt in service of her upcoming film”, I’d like to offer that commercial success aligned, even self-servingly, with a mass students’ movement against fascism and the establishment is a morally superior way to profit than sucking up (or staying silent) to the shit that’s going down. 

Sure there is intellectual purity in being consistent about opposing these thugs, but the coalition will (and should) include the late adopters and bandwagon-joiners;To all those saying this is a PR stunt for Chapak, you really think the best way to promote a movie in this country today is to piss off the violent right wing mob?

Is that why Akshay Kumar sucks up to Modi and waves the ABVP flag high? Huh? He should have come to Jamia or JNU if that's the way to promote a movie.

Stop being such cynics and distancing influencers.;IT cell tried hard, but I support deepika came out on top;thank God this time these celebrities are not being diplomatic and saying it clearly.;Huge huge respect!;This is huge.. Deepika is, in many ways, like today's Madhuri Dixit. The country's biggest female star, that is. It takes balls of titanium to do what she's doing - make a bold statement in an atmosphere where doing so could be virtual professional kamikaze. 

Hope this inspires the most powerful Bollywood stars - the Khans, to man the fuck up and say something. 

And of course, more power to Deepika. She might just have reignited the revolution.;So is she a terrorist or just an anti-national?;Modia is accusing her as a PR stunt for her incoming movie.;Is there any movie releasing soon?;Damn.

They don’t come into limelight because they get death threats, derogatory comments. It’s really bold because they know that they are a normal Indian citizen and not some privilege, high-valued person. And as I mentioned, she started getting threatened by andha bhakts.

Edit :

--||--

The whole thing was a massive failure of hindutva radicals, whole plan starts with a muslim festival called 'Tablighi Ijtema' 10 lakh muslims come into this festival, GUESS WHAT? the cow meat head & carcass incident happen at the same time of 'Tablighi Ijtema'. The plan was to trigger hindus and make them attack muslims which will have a MASSIVE reaction from muslims since there are already jam pact 10 lakh muslim present in the place, If everything goes as planned this would be one of the biggest riot and Violence against hindus by muslims.

Which means only one thing : Complete victory of BJP in 2019

But thing took a complete 180, FIR was registered against 7 muslims (two of them are minors 11 & 12 year old) (some of them don't exist and others used to live here 10 years ago and never came back), Immediately after that Hindu radical organization started rampaging throughout the city, WHAT NEXT? 0 reaction from 10 lakh muslims, almost all of the muslims returned to their homes/cities/villages after the festival, there was complete silence of muslim communities regarding the cow carcass case.

THING ISN'T OVER! The hero cop, martyr Subodh Kumar Singh took the case (he was the same cop who took dadri lynching case), Bajrang dal got panicked because if the case got truly investigated then it would be revealed that this whole thing was set up. We all know what happened next. A hindu did died, not by muslims but radical hindutva thugs.

The war was waged by Indians to save the constitution. 

""Muslims are Indians By CHOICE."" What everybody should know.

The preamble was read. A decision was made.
Call towards Civil Disobedience.

""If anybody comes for NPR to our homes, give them tea. Don't provide them any documents.""

The slogans were mainly,
- Zindabad Zindabad, Hindustan Zindabad,
- Wo Ambedkar Waali, Azaadi,
- Waapis lo waapis lo...

Muslim Ulama (Respected Scholars) participated in Freedom struggle back then. They do so now. And just like you, They want a free secular India...

It was the beginning of many protests. It didn't halt with the end of Dua (supplication to Allah).

It halted with our National Anthem.

>If any one wants to see his name in the selected list of the citizens of Assam then they have to submit a form with any ‘List A’ documents to prove his residence in the state before March 25, 1971.

>If anybody claims that his/ her ancestors are native residents of the Assam then he/she has to submit a form with any document mentioned in the ‘List B’.

http://www.nrcassam.nic.in/admin-documents.html

List A documents includes;

1. Electoral rolls upto March 25, 1971
2. NRC of 1951
3. Land and tenancy records
4. Citizenship certificate
5.Permanent resident certificate
6.Passport
7.Bank or LIC documents
8. Permanent Residential Certificate
9.Educational certificates and court order records
10.Refugee Registration Certificate



List B documents includes;

1 .Land documents
2. Board or university certificates
3. Birth certificate
4. Bank/LIC/post office records
5. Ration card
6. Electoral rolls
7. Other legally acceptable documents
8. A circle officer or gram panchayat secretary certificate for married women

In this case, Kareem would successfully prove that he is a citizen because he has many of these documents (documents in List B contain the name of his father, and are sufficient to prove his relationship) whereas Raju would fail. Raju could apply for citizenship, but he needs to prove he's lived in India for 6 years (IIRC). Which I doubt he'll be able to prove because he has no documents. I doubt Raju can even prove he's a Hindu. 

Edit: The problem with this graphic is that it already has an agenda to push and goes on to do it without caring whether it makes sense. With all the documentation Kareem has, it is extremely easy to prove who his father is. Almost every legal document in India also mentions the name of your father. 

Edit: The explicit absense of Muslims from the CAB (CAA now) is still wrong. It should include all persecuted minorities in South Asia. granted, the intent of the amendment is to make it easier for persecuted minorities to immigrate. However, There are many Muslim minority sects that face persecution in our neighbouring countries and excluding them goes against the secular ethos of our constitution.

Secondly, such immigration should not be forced upon the Assamese. Let them decide if they want to allow the illegals or not for themselves.;That is why protest is going on at Assam. We aren't protesting because we are liberals or seculars. We are protesting for every other illegal immigrants irrespective of their religions.

I have seen quite a few documentaries on how the European nobility pitted people against one another and then uses this to start religious cleansing and also use the witch trials as a scapegoat for whatever bad was happening, notice a pattern there?

As to, whats the impact of this to the economy. Will it be positive? because there will be less people to feed?;For the question in the photo about proving relationship to father. Almost all the documents listed in the photo have father's name in it.ex: driving license.
Isn't that enough to prove my relationship with my parent?;Aah, lot of religious bull shit. When will we start regarding each other as humans and not ""hindu that , muslim this ,bhakth that.. Fukin hell.;Watching Gandhi made me sad a little. He must be rolling over in his grave. This isn't the India he wanted or even remotely dreamt of;Disenfranchise muslims. Given citizenship and thus voting rights to non muslims. Get majority in all elected positions. Go full fash. That's their plan. They will create a Hindu Rashtra. Our only option is to fight back by any and all means necessary.;What is citizenship?;100% true.;So, till now we all are Ghuspetiya!!;What was the extent of the Supreme Court's involvement with all this? Because isn't an NRC something that the Supreme Court wanted in the first place?;Yup, that’s one of the cases of NRC + CAB.;Logically all of them are Muslim majority country also(besides Muslim) those are minority people in those  country as well ,this amendment is for those people who are minority in those country and were citizen of those country but they are come to our land before this amendment and wants to be part of this country  (I'm not bhakt BTW , and i live in the village and also for some reason a muslim friend of my grand father is staying in the house, so don't get me wrong : ) );Wait...people want Indian citizenship?;Partly True. But even Hindus don't get citizenship under NRC. There are so many Hindu people who were left out of NRC as well, for now. But it's easier for non-Muslim than Muslims to be accepted back into NRC in case they were accidentally left out as many Indian Hindu and Muslims are in Assam. 

The Hindu being born in Dhaka to be considered Indian is only possible due to CAB. Without CAB there was no talk of giving anyone citizenship from outside India. The poster is part misinformation. 
NRC was about documenting all the indians(irrespective of religion) to allow deporting of Illegals immigrants from Anywhere not just Bangladesh. But since only Northeast had major illegal immigration problem throughout it's history of existence. The demand for NRC was first started in Assam. But BJP brought in CAB alongwith NRC. They also weaponized the NRC against muslims which was never demanded in Assam. In fact NRC was created after just to document Indian citizen.;Don't know where these people would go, except to concentration camps like Uighurs in China.
Not a dictatorship yet, but unofficially two people are doing what they want and no opposition can do anything about it;Ya it's not so simple. For example it is wrong if Kareem is in oppressed minority. But atleaset they managed to save 1 guy.;True;I just wanted to know, These NRC detained people would be detained, sure. They have families which have mixed with the indigenous Bengali(or any other) population of the country. Splitting them would be the most fucked up human rights violation imaginable. What are we gonna do with these refugees?;I admit, I have no idea why they would try to do this after years of slacking off. Making it retrospective is even worse. If they take away the citizenship of people living here for generations (even 2 or more) they'll be separating families. This also carries the unnecessary risk of riots and increased communal tension. This is just plain not needed, and it's sad that they're so focused on this rather than putting the economy in a better shape.;Still dont know what NRC is;Any Law is a Good Law only if it Implementable,

what if

\- someone comes in  Illegally to India and he is a Muslim,Atheist or Satanist.

\-After seeing this law he gets afraid and converts to Hinduism/Buddhism (Ghar wapsi).

\-What will the govt do now if he claims he had converted to Hinduism in Bangaldesh ? and they chased him away in Bangaldesh due to his conversion ?

Are converted Muslims still acceptable in this law? Hindu, Muslim , atheist these are all Just virtual placeholders for fictitious gods, Muslims can easliy say they converted to Buddhism or Hinduism and go through the loophole, or maybe I am being too naive that was the whole purpose of this law I think, was to give a signal to Muslims to convert to Hindusim...;This current management keeps glorifying India's defense capabilities and has forgotten the immense contribution in this field by by someone great belonging to the very religion  they are against.

The concept of HR is a joke. What you hear in the news about the violence is the truth. Indians are a proud lot and we don't like our identities being stripped off us. Before the religion, we believe we are Indians first and that is why people of different religions get upset when mistreated or persecuted because you are then attacking your own people.
More the oppression, the greater the suffering and more the suffering greater the pain and more the pain greater the anger. This leads to conflict. Conflict is bad. It puts a state in perpetual state of mismanagement and instability that is bad, very very bad for the finance. Investments go away, funds dry up. It was because of the relative peace and stability post 2000 (after 1947 we have fought the kargil war, the indo-china war to name a few. Then the khalistan rebellion and the rise of the underworld, but all this was pre 2000) that the IT boom happened in India, foreign companies set up their offices and a lot of investment poured in. All that will dry up if this disaster were to happen. 

Imagine yourself in the shoes of a person running a multi billion dollar empire. Why would you continue running your operations in a country which has lost it's way and become unstable, immature and backward? Especially if there are alternatives available. 

And the more the management tries to force their agenda more the conflict will grow.
Things can go from bad to worse any moment. Simply put, we really can't afford a shake down now. It will blow up finance. Instead of firing employees or discriminating against them the management should focus on issues in the financial department and take more responsibility towards the environment. And really they should conduct some training programs for ALL their employees to make them abreast with modern day philosophy and society.;For shame, my beloved country, for shame.;This is the whole point of the protest!;India becoming like nazi state day by day..."

Edit: since many people asked this in follow up comments, this happened at KFC in the domestic terminal at Bangalore airport.

Edit: Ravi Shankar Prasad is on television right now, blatantly lying, and claiming that the government always supported the right to privacy. 

Edit #2: 
As the judgment reports, the Government of India argued that there was there was no right to privacy in India. Some people are falsely claiming that the  government said there should be a qualified right to privacy. If you look at paragraph 135 of the judgment (see [here](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rules-privacy-is-fundamental-right-here-s-full-text-of-the-judgment/story-Wheiu7B8nbgbqtJYT1KzkO.html)) it clearly states that: 

>""135 The Attorney General for India, leading the arguments before this Court on
behalf of Union of India, has been critical of the recognition being given to a general
right of privacy. The submission has several facets, among them being:
(i) there is no general or fundamental right to privacy under the Constitution""

Only if this argument is rejected are they willing to concede that maybe there could possibly be a qualified right to privacy. But that's their alternative submission if their main argument fails. The main argument was still there is no right to privacy. Have some self-respect, don't grovel and make excuses for a government that doesn't care about you.

Some excerpts:


> I do not think that anybody in this country would like to have
the officers of the State intruding into their homes or private
property at will or soldiers quartered in their houses without their 
consent. **I do not think that anybody would like to be told by the
State as to what they should eat or how they should dress or whom
they should be associated with either in their personal, social or
political life.** Freedom of social and political association is
guaranteed to citizens under Article 19(1)(c). Personal association
is still a doubtful area.61 The decision making process regarding
the freedom of association, freedoms of travel and residence are
purely private and fall within the realm of the right of privacy. It is
one of the most intimate decisions.
All liberal democracies believe that the State should not have
unqualified authority to intrude into certain aspects of human life
and that the authority should be limited by parameters
constitutionally fixed. **Fundamental rights are the only
constitutional firewall to prevent State's interference with those core
freedoms constituting liberty of a human being. The right to
privacy is certainly one of the core freedoms which is to be
defended.** It is part of liberty within the meaning of that expression
in Article 21. 


AND


> The Attorney General argued before us that the right to privacy must be
forsaken in the interest of welfare entitlements provided by the State. In our view, the
submission that the right to privacy is an elitist construct which stands apart from the 
needs and aspirations of the large majority constituting the rest of society, is
unsustainable. This submission betrays a misunderstanding of the constitutional
position. Our Constitution places the individual at the forefront of its focus,
guaranteeing civil and political rights in Part III and embodying an aspiration for
achieving socio- economic rights in Part IV. **The refrain that the poor need no civil
and political rights and are concerned only with economic well-being has been utilised
though history to wreak the most egregious violations of human rights.** Above all, it
must be realised that it is the right to question, the right to scrutinize and the right to
dissent which enables an informed citizenry to scrutinize the actions of government.
Those who are governed are entitled to question those who govern, about the
discharge of their constitutional duties including in the provision of socio-economic
welfare benefits. The power to scrutinize and to reason enables the citizens of a
democratic polity to make informed decisions on basic issues which govern their
rights. **The theory that civil and political rights are subservient to socio-economic rights
has been urged in the past and has been categorically rejected in the course of
constitutional adjudication by this Court.** 


Fuck this Government. Aadhaar must die! ;What impact does it have on schemes related to aadhar pushed by GoI down to its citizen's throat.;What exactly is the definition of privacy as per the judgement of the Supreme Court. I ask this question because it seems like a very vague term particularly in the context of provision of private and government services to citizens. If you take privacy at face value ('a state in which one is not observed or disturbed by other people.
'), then you could refuse to provide personal details to any individual or organization. If a bank asks for your home details for account opening, you could simply refuse citing privacy. If google asks for your phone number during account opening, you could again refuse citing privacy. And on and on for innumerable types of services. The phrase 'right to privacy' itself is not even mentioned in the constitution. The judges have made privacy a fundamental right by stating that privacy is a subset of article 21 which is 'Right to Life and Personal Liberty'. But this article 21 is utter fluff since it comes with a huge disclaimer that rights guaranteed under article 21 can be superseded by procedure established by law. Ultimately, I feel this judgement is toothless since absolute privacy cannot be achieved and is not even desirable (imagine all the rich people who don't pay taxes finding a way to hide their spending from the govt ). The govt has extensive legislative tools at its disposal to circumvent this verdict. But I do expect that in the coming months a large of individuals will petition to the courts to exclude them from providing person details to organisations. And when the courts examine the cases on an individual basis, they themselves will realize that absolute privacy is simply impossible and impractical.    ;Faith has been restored. Take that Aadhar shoving Modi.;So now if my relatives pressurize me to marry, I can take them to court right?  😀;Thank god,sanity prevails.I was particularly cynical about this judgement and am very glad to be proven wrong. ;Phew!.... that was scary... after multiple flip flops to finally come to this judgement!!.

Aadhar was and always should be optional. ;🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏;We need a right to define ""Reasonable Restrictions"" - as that phrase challenges all our fundamental rights.;A nine judge bench is going to decide whether everyone has a fundamental right to privacy.

This site (along with its selfless contributors) have helped shape my understanding of the world.;May I please get the link?;Another way to donate is via Brave Web Browser. 

Brave has built in ad, track and script blocker so you can surf the web without ads. Ofcource this takes away revenue of website who depends on it. 

Brave also has a feature called Brave Reward. It is based on a concept where user is paid to watch ads on their own time (not while surfing). User is paid in cryptocurrency called BAT - Basic Attention Token. Then you can ask the browser to distribute a fixed amount every month to website of your choice based on your usage. 

Say, you spent 10% of time on Wikipedia, 20% on porn hub, 15% on reddit and so on and your monthly limit is 10$, Brave will give 10% of 10$ to Wikipedia and so on.

There is another option called Tip. In the address bar it will show if website is verified publisher (they have tied up with brave to receieve earnings donated by users) and you can just click tip - 5$ and continue with your work. 

Recently they have added the option to tip users on twitter and reddit (you can tip this comment). 

Currently, ads are not live in India so we can't ""earn"" at the moment. Only way is you buy BAT and fill your wallet with the amount or just use brave's promotional grant ( they give 5-10$ every month to new users to tip the publishers). 

I have donated 25$ since yesterday to Wikipedia via BAT and it is fucking easy. 

Even if you are not interested in this reward feature, the browser is excellent to surf web without ads.;Too bad they don't have more accessible transfer options. Even if I choose to pay with my debit card it won't be accepted because it's RuPay Card and they use only Visa and Mastercard.;Why they are asking for PAN number for amount less than ₹ 50,000?;[deleted];Bhai who drinks ₹150 coffee???;Donated 325.

I find it quite surprising that the British were the first to have the entire Indian subcontinent under their control, with the Mughal Empire coming second with only the south and some parts of the east outside their control.;Just adding something here: The Chozha Empire also had influence in south-east Asia. Raja Raja Chozha had captured several kingdoms there such as the Tambralinga, Kedah etc. South-east Asia also has significant Tamil and Sanskrit influence.

I've seen several such simulations of Indian empires and almost all of them leave that bit out. It's probably only because SE Asia is a bit far off, but I also think it's important to include it. It's not always that we see an Indian naval power.;Cool gif OP

Why was the South harder to conquer? I know they often had strong kingdoms and were quite wealthy from sea trade, not to mention they were farthest from the northern conquerors, but I'd appreciate it if someone could provide some more details or resources.

;Surprising to See Tamil Nadu was never under any foreign rule until the British. Maybe that explains a lot. ;Observations gleaned from (& beyond) this graphic as to the contrast between Mughals and British rules:

The Mughal rule united the disparate kingdoms into one consolidated whole. The Mughal Empire superseded its fragmented predecessors, which, in all probability, would not have agreed to come together to form what is most of today's India, were it not for the unifying rule. The interesting thing is that they continued being part of the newly forged geographical land even *after* the demise of the Mughal Empire. 

But, then came the British plague.

The British, interestingly, controlled even more geographical territory than the Mughals did. But, the aftermath of the British rule was such that, as the sun began to set on it, the subcontinent once again regressed to its tendency to disintegrate into smaller, autonomous units. 

Two foreign empires. Two diametrically opposite stories: One, despite all its massive shortcomings, made India its home, united it, enriched it, stabilized it and protected it for centuries. The other divided India, ransacked it, enslaved it, and, essentially, *annihilated* it irreparably. 




;You missed the Kushan Empire and Maharaja Ranjit Singh Empire.

Also, maybe Rajputana was an empire, but I am not sure. ;I’m really dumb but can someone explain to me when a certain region was under the control of an empire, what were the other parts of the country doing?

-

- She bought a pistol for the first time pistol in 2016, her shooting experience is less than 2yrs

- Her international experience is just 1 year

;Such a long ass title and no name in it. ;That's great! We should make these type of sports more accessible to people. Shooting is an incredibly expensive sport to get started on, at least for the majority of Indians.

There is a government managed shooting academy about one hour distance from my house. A few years ago, I thought that my aims were pretty sharp, and there is anyway a shooting academy so close to my place. So, I should at least go and try it. What if I am really good at it and I never knew?

So, I went there along with one of my friends to inquire about it. There were some people shooting in the shooting range, some students were being trained etc. It seemed pretty fun, so I went to the office to ask more details on how to join.

All I wanted was to see if I have any talent in this sport. The person in the office said that I will have to first take membership for the shooting academy which will either cost some 20k per year, or 50k for lifetime. I said that I am new to this, and all I want to do is try it for few days, and if I am good at it, I will register for the membership. He said that the only way to join is by taking these memberships.

I was a student at that time, so I couldn't afford paying that much on my own, but I was earning a reasonable income from my websites, so if I wanted, I could take the membership. So, I decided to ask more details.

I asked if I can try one of their guns in the shooting range for a trial. Afterall, without shooting a single bullet, how would I know that if I have any talent for it? How would I know if it is worth it to spend so much money on a membership?

He said that it is not possible to try, and also that the shooting academy doesn't own any guns! He said that you will have to buy your own guns, and the clothing required to be used while shooting! He said the overall cost for a gun used in this sports will start at 1.5lakh, and if you want a good gun then you should buy the ones over 3lakh! He said it costs this much because they are imported.

^^*All ^^the ^^costs ^^mentioned ^^in ^^this ^^post ^^are ^^approximates. ^^This ^^happened ^^many ^^years ^^ago ^^and ^^I ^^dont ^^remember ^^the ^^exact ^^figures.

At that point, I decided that it is not worth it and left. I thought in my mind - What is the point of having a government-owned shooting range if they don't even have a gun to shoot?

- I am paying more n more on fuel in lieu of taxes inspite of low crude prices worldwide till few months back
- GST did not bring any benefit to my household spends really. The spend is more or less similar or higher for the same headcount in our family 
- Many in my extended family are jobless despite the relevant qualification - no govt jobs n pvt jobs are limited. They are ending up doing menial/irrelevant jobs which don't require their education.
- Nothing really has changed on the infrastructure front. For me to build a house for my own living, the prices have gone up from 1200/sft to 2200-2500/sft. Don't talk about land / plot prices which have sky rocketed.
- I don't have a business, but many I know, do complain of liquidity issues in the market 
- I feel more hatred is brewing between people/communities now compared to before, thanks to the provocative talks n behaviour.

Famines have also been an intriguing part of recent history in India. Unfortunately, they do not attract much attention, no doubt  due to the public discourse here which has made people ignore the horrors of British imperialism, while focussing their energies entirely on the Mughal rule.

[Millions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36339524) of Indians died in famines.

 Over [4 million](https://yourstory.com/2017/08/british-raj-famines) died as recently as 1943! 

There were more than 31 famines in 120 years during the British rule, compared to about 17 in the [previous 2000 years](https://yourstory.com/2017/08/british-raj-famines)!

Famines were a regular feature of life in India in the [19th century](http://www.environmentandsociety.org/exhibitions/famines-india/timeline/famines-india-timeline), to which the British rulers turned a convenient [blind eye](https://www.thoughtco.com/famine-in-india-nineteenth-century-195148).

There is so little documentation of the lives of these people by the English-speaking Indian elite of the time and the British masters, that it is tough to know the true stories of the sufferers.

For systematically bleeding India, for the deaths of millions of Indians and for ruining the economy - the effects of which India is still recovering from - the British owe not just an apology, they owe [full reparations](https://youtu.be/2bkQmgNru5I).

But in the same vein, we must also remember that even after Independence, tribal regions of [Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/death-by-starvation-31046) have continued to suffer famines on a larger scale; while chronic malnutrition, hunger and starvation deaths plague all regions of the country, irrespective of state or party in power.
 [Kalahandi](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/special-report/story/19850731-orissa-drought-famine-force-women-in-kalahandi-to-abandon-and-sell-their-children-770267-2013-12-27) district of Orissa had remained synonymous with hunger and poverty for decades after Independence.

Deaths due to starvation [continue to occur](https://www.ucanews.com/news/starvation-deaths-haunt-india-despite-economic-growth/82968), even in [New Delhi](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/starvation-deaths-in-delhi-india-is-great-but-we-indians-are-definitely-not).

[Hunger continues](https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/death-by-hunger-is-india-s-tragic-reality/story-5lNVR6Q2LXXjEsQrnIeGdL.html)  to be the stark reality for millions of Indians.

However, because of the huge stigma attached to starvation deaths, these data are [forged by local authorities](https://sabrangindia.in/article/death-hunger-activists-protest-government-inaction-over-starvation-deaths) to make them appear as deaths due infectious diseases.

India seems to be sharply divided along political ideologies, yet no political party can claim to have eliminated starvation and malnutrition. 

Even in the recent few years, [upto 56 deaths](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/2-brothers-starve-to-death-in-up-revealing-a-torn-social-security-net-118102300187_1.html) have been reported due to hunger.

'The government can't get away with large scale famine, but it can get away with chronic hunger. It has become an accepted part of life in India.' Jean Dreze, economist.

;Churchill was a scumbag

*change my mind*;Naanka famine of 1866 in odisha lasted for two years and caused one million deaths which was a third of the population. There is evidence of revenue officers underestimating the need for food grains. 

A story goes that revenue officials saw women wearing bronze Bangles and thought that it was gold, therefore they underestimated how poor the people were and food prices were kept high.

And no sirs and madams of the internet world, you don't have a right to assign blame or demand apologies unless and until we make ourselves free of blame. 
So stop whining and get to work helping instead of masturbating on Reddit like me. 

Oh btw Brits have gone long back but we still are having cases of starvation deaths. Not only in the north East chai bagans but sometimes in heart of the city like calcutta too.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans.

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

In short, the act is discriminatory in nature as it clearly states that India is only interested in taking non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Coupled with NRC, CAA will create a hostile environment for Indian Muslims where they will be at the complete mercy of the government.","An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact",0.95,"If you are an Indian muslim and you have documents dating before 2014 proving your presence in India (say, birth certificate or passport), will you also have to prove your citizenship then?;My father just stated today that India shouldn't have been made secular.

>Does this mean that Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan can never get Indian citizenship?  
>  
>No, the present legal process of acquiring Indian citizenship by any foreigner of any category through Naturalization (Section 6 of the Citizenship Act) or through Registration (Section 5 of the Act) stays operational. The CAA does not amend or alter it in any manner whatsoever. Hundreds of Muslims migrating from these three countries have been granted Indian citizenship during the last few years. If found eligible, all such future migrants shall also get Indian citizenship, irrespective of their numbers or religion. In 2014, after the settlement of Indo-Bangladesh boundary issues, 14,864 Bangladeshi citizens were given the Indian Citizenship when their enclaves were incorporated into the territory of India. Thousands of these foreigners were Muslims.

You've asserted:

>So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"".

Am I missing something?;Hey, since you seem to have a good grasp about the issue, can you please help me identify the core issue with CAA+NRC. 

From what I can see as of now it discriminates muslims from outside India (especially the Rohingyas). 


I feel there is some merit to the point that giving citizenship to Muslims from Bangladesh Pakistan is not needed (I have an open mind about the issue, please convince me if you can why this is wrong - But please dont just say India is secular and it discriminates).


Also, from what I can see, as of now the Indian Muslims are safe. As the criteria for NRC has not been announced for people outside Assam so like I mentioned in the other comment, saying we are sure they(Indian Muslims) will be asked to provide extraordinary proof is not a solid ground for protests as it has not been announced.


(Once again I really want to understand why this is wrong, so that I can educate others. Just saying secular and discrimination and Indian constitution is not an educated argument.

>Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof

What is the extraordinary proof that will be required and how will it be different from the proof that non-Muslim-non migrants will require?

If you are not in the special case covered by the CAA, you'll be subject to rest of The Citizenship Act, 1955, which lays out [four principal ways](https://indiancitizenshiponline.nic.in/acquisition1.htm) through which Indian citizenship can be acquired (Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization). Wouldn't a lot of people be eligible at least to acquire citizenship by naturalization? As far as I know, the 1955 act applies to every person irrespective of their religion. Only the CAA lays out a special condition for non-muslim migrants from three countries, that of a reduced time (five years) to be eligible for naturalization.

The purpose of the NRC would be to make sure that everybody tagged as an Indian citizen has the documented proofs that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the 1955 act, namely Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization.

For example, one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of India for 12 years, so that you're eligible for citizenship by naturalization. My understanding is that it's not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in India for twelve years for most people.

It might be hard for the homeless but wouldn't that be a problem for everybody? Including non-muslims who aren't migrants? Because the CAA only applies to non-muslims **who are also** migrants from those three countries and have been a resident of India since at least 31 December 2014.

And even if you don't have documented proof there are other provisions [such as  witnesses or local proofs supported by members of the community, as clarified by the MHA Spokesperson yesterday](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-indian-will-have-to-prove-ancestry-common-documents-will-be-enough-mha-1630201-2019-12-20).

I think that people might be confusing the Assam NRC process for the one that will be implemented nationwide. The Assam NRC guidelines were laid out by the Supreme Court in 2015 specifically for Assam and as of today no official guideline, or process or procedure exists for the nationwide NRC exercise.

So I'm not sure if it's right to be jumping to conclusions if we don't even know what the nationwide NRC exercise will look like.;You need to specify your country of origin for getting citizenship under CAB, isn't it ?;Pls make a correction in the text of your 4th clarification - China has a horrible record against Muslims as well (Uighurs).;I have a doubt. 

Since CAA only gives citizenship to the immigrants who can prove they were persecuted based on the religion, when Pan India NRC is applied, if a poor Muslim ( who is not an immigrant ) fails to provide any document, so will a poor Hindu. What is the way out for Hindus here?;This may sound dumb.... but according to CAA the Hindus, christian,etc, not having proper documents for NRC need to prove they have come from the 3 mentioned countries to get the citizenship or are they not required to do so????;>The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship.

How? ""Automatically"" how?;Thanks..this needs to be everywhere;"" That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. ""

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but I do not think the act automatically confers citizenship onto those non-muslims. It simply alters their status and no longer declares them an illegal immigrant but i do not believe that is the same as conferring citizenship onto them. In fact, they need to undergo the process to obtain certificates as listed under the newly introduced section 6B wherein despite being no longer considered an illegal immigrant, you would have to either pass the citizenship requirements as per Section 5 of the Citizenship Act as it currently stands, or the process of naturalization under the Third Schedule after which you may be considered for citizenship as per such certificates as under 6B.

Note- I am in no way supportive of the bill. I believe it is in blatant disregard of Article 14 of the Constitution and should be struck down with due time. However, I do not think such speculations should be equated with fact. Facts are separate and speculations are separate.  


Edit- Added Section 5;I am sure there are a number of readers who still may not have full clarity on the CAA and NRC. Yes, there is a sticky, but both the pro-government and anti-government rhetoric tends to develop their own biases and eco-chambers.

Where do we draw the line? Is the CAA and NRC worth the flak the government is getting? And why should one oppose it?
Based on my own understanding so far, I am trying to draw an overall understanding of this issue: please feel free to argue from any angle you may have (supporting or opposing the Act or expanding on any points)

__________________________________________________________________

**Background**

- India is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention and is not bound to take any refugees whatsoever. There are a number of states that are currently facing increased (illegal) immigration since past few decades.

- This increased illegal immigration over the years mixed with apathy and vote-bank politics by the relevant govts. has turned people hostile toward illegal immigrants in India. There were/are no adequate policies toward settling these migrants or checks in terms of documentation etc. Decreasing job prospects and a fear of increased crimes and marginalization became a grave concern for the local population. Border being highly porous does not help either.

- Comes in: a demand for more stringent attitude toward citizenship/settlement and checking one's legal status in the country. It goes more complicated from here - with a simple fact being that all parties - Congress, BJP, and regional ones - tried to tap into the people's fear and came up with various policies.


**NRC (National Register of Citizens of India)**

- **Overview:** Personal bias, but, I am in favor of it - *theoretically*. I do find that India needs a comprehensive Citizens' Register. Nearly all the EU countries have it. Idea is pretty self-explanatory - keep a comprehensive register of all the citizens and cross-verify their documents. Any new citizen/birth etc. could be provided a National ID etc etc. Sounds good in theory. And document-check might just weed out the illegal immigrants too.

- **Problem?**  I am of the opinion that most policy execution in India is half-baked and creates a lot more problems than it solves. In fact, it might not be an opinion after all - NRC has been attempted in various forms since the 1960's. Government itself found the proposal to have an NRC in Assam impractical. Case in point: introduction of Aadhar. Or demonetization for that matter.

- **Problem II?** This country has ~25% of the population that is unable to read or write adequately. ~70% of our population is rural that tends to have lack of documentation etc. I'd extrapolate anywhere between 50-60% of our country lacks proper documents. Note the list of documents and cut-off date keeps changing. Furthermore, I fail to see any relevant post-WWII evidence in any democratic country in the world where they asked the entire population to prove their citizenship. 

- **Counterpoint:** 1.2B Aadhar cards have been issued till date and 900M people have Voter ID card. That leaves approx. <30M people who may potentially not have no Aadhar or Voter ID for that matter. A well-managed/multi-step document check might mitigate the fear of people due to the lack of documents.

- **Counterpart II:** NRC is critical for the North-East that have bore the grunt of illegal immigration since the 60s/70s at least - from the post-Bangladesh refugee wave (predominantly Hindus), to Chakmas and Hajongs (Buddhists), to the recent Rohingyas (Muslims). The fact that the North East lacks the economic growth and resources only adds to the fuel. At least *some* step is critically required to solve the issue of illegal immigrants to the country. 


**CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act):**

- **The Rohingyas:** Lets start with the North-East and the influx of the Rohingyas. 40k+ Rohingyas sought refuge in India after the Burmese government expelled them. Burmese do not consider Rohingyas as their citizens as they consider them as immigrants brought in from Bangladesh during the British Raj. Bangladesh, unsurprisingly, is of the position that they are the natives of Myanmar and should be protected by that government. Do note that Bangladesh is now home to 1.1M Rohingya refugees. More importantly, both parties have used refugees for vote-banks: in 2015, 40,000 Chakmas/Hajongs were naturalized as Indian citizens despite the protests by Arunachal Pradesh. 


- **Act - what is it about?** Members of the Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Zoroastrian communities who have come from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014 and facing religious persecution there (no documentary evidence required) will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship. It also relaxes the provisions for ""Citizenship by naturalization"". 
The law reduces duration of residency from existing 11 years to just 5 years for people belonging to the same six religions and three countries. **One could argue** - what is the issue with reducing the residency requirement for minority sects from aforementioned countries? Several democratic countries around the world have precedence where they permit a reduced time for naturalization for certain sects/ethnicities due to atrocities committed (eg. Germany for ethnic Jews during the Third Reich, Spain for Sephardic Jews expelled in the 17th century!)

- **Current scenario:** CAA aims to put a hard stop on illegal immigration/asylum by the Muslims. Whether there is merit to it or not is a difficult topic between balancing humanitarianism which remains one of the core foundations of our country and ensuring national security. Proponents of the latter claim that it is easier for, say, an Islamic fundamentalist to pose as an ordinary Muslim - the fact that India does not have adequate infrastructure and apparatus in place to ensure a thorough intelligence adds to the pressure. 

- **Counterpoint to above:** I fail to see how approving citizenship to all the illegal immigrants actually serves any purpose. Illegal immigration to the North-East could continue to remain an issue and create pressure on local population. If possible, settle them across India (but of course, this is not much talked about)

------------------------------------------------------


- **Why we should protest?** On one hand, it doesn't sound so bad, particularly for the urban-dwellers: Governments asks you to prove your citizenship, show them documents. And guess what? With CAA, we are also mitigating the issue of illegal immigration as well to quite an extent. (unless you are a Muslim) And if you are unable to show documents, well - tough luck - you'll be scrutinized. One could argue that anyhow, we are supposed to prove our legal status in the country during the passport application etc. 

And that is where the problem lies. The scrutiny, administrative execution, and removal of a certain religion. A significant number of people may fail to pass this documentation scrutiny: especially if they are from the lower socio-economic status which, coincidentally, has a higher proportion of Muslims. Add to the fact that if declared illegal immigrant owing to the fact that they could not yield relevant documents, that person from Muslim population risks detention or deportation (to where?) in the country s/he was born and raised in.


- **Counterpoint:** Nonetheless, I would still like to ask - what should be done to resolve the current and prevent and manage further illegal immigration to India?;> That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to  non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a  nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to  prove their Indian citizenship.

I'm no lawyer, but I don't see how you can twist the proposed section 2 amendment (in the second page) to legalize all non-muslim illegals (i.e., those that don't have enough documents to prove their citizenship and hence wouldn't be included in an NRC, not actual illegals who jumped across), unless the government goes to increased lengths in declaring a Telugu or a Kannadiga Hindu dude as ""someone fleeing from persecution in Sindh/Chittagong/Kandahar"";I have a doubt: 

Will every Indian Muslim be required to submit proof of Indian ancestry?

After listening to some news from Sir Ravish Kumar I drafted some answer. Please spread awareness and make sure if you want to question yourself or if anybody else around you questions the above, you make them aware by sharing the following.

Answer -

 Like Amit Shah quoted, there are so many universities in India and only few protested. Not all.

Why don't you understand that, there were so many many many many peaceful protests in India (in non BJP states) and not all were this way? 

Also, not long ago, in revolt to the release of a movie we had people doing Violence and [attack School bus filled with kids](https://theprint.in/opinion/karni-sena-schoolbus-modi-padmaavat/31473/). 

Did Police Lathi charge then? Why now? Because we know who the violence was from.

Anyway, all this doesn't make these protests with Violence right.

It Also doesn't justify the use of ruthless violence against Students by Police inside their Universities. Only prisoners get beaten up this way. Not Students.

And at last -

I appeal the Protestors, please protest peacefully.

And I also request everybody to not abandon the cause because of a few such posts questioning your cause.

Only answer I could come up for some blind people is - Get well soon.

I realise, using the word Bhakt (devotee) is wrong for people such as these. So, it is better to use some other words for them. (I don't know. Keep a nice name.)

Please copy this and spread this across. Edit it so it looks better. But please do this. We need everybody to know the truth and not stand ideally frozen when some people ask such questions.

1. The act will legalize all the refugees from three countries, accept Muslims ,and award citizenship . Is it not discriminatory?
2.

That too accept Muslim!! If humanities is considered in respect of Afghanistan, generosity should be extended to all type citizens of Afghanistan, but no, except Muslims!!
3. If there is an existing law, which  allows these refugees to obtain Indian citizenship, why that system is not being applied? Because in that system Muslims will also be awarded citizenship!! But now, after CAA, Muslim refugees will never be plowed to obtain Indian citizenship. Is it true?
4. It is said, Indians will not be affected by CAA, but is justifiable if a Muslim refugee from Pakistan or Bangladesh living in India more then 30-40 years will be treated as “ ghuspathiya” and be asked to leave the country or live in detention camp!!

I had a question regarding the above quote. The Act does not specifically say anything along lingual or racial lines, only religious - does the above statement imply that Sri Lankan Tamil refugees are all considered Muslim? And if they are not, why do they fear deportation?;I have a few questions. Please help me understand this better. 

So the law was instituted to supposedly protect minorities from these 3 countries, right ?

If that is the case, then is there a sizeable population of Muslim minorities in these predominantly Muslim countries? 

So if someone was born in India between 1954 and present, shouldn’t their birth certificate or other such documentation be enough to prove citizenship? How does all that work?

Supposing someone’s parents or grandparents have been Indian citizens from 1947 onwards but they don’t have their documents with them. Will their children or grandchildren - having been born in India to Indian parents, who presumably have some form of documentation- not be able to confirm their citizenship?

Also just an FYI, I have just been alerted to this situation. I am simply trying to educate myself on the issue and am trying to understand the facts. I am not looking for accusations or criticism. 

Cheers;If you’re an Indian Muslim and have legally stayed for over 11 years in this country and completed the naturalisation and have officially become an Indian citizen , are you safe from CAA and NRC?"

We all speak equality, but it is a plain lie. The caste discrimination stills exists in India and I don't think it will end anytime soon.

Black, White, Biege, Yellow or Red. Outsider is an outsider. 

They'll drop the 'stuff' on ground or place it on the table and you place the money on the table. That's how it works. 

It was an strange feeling though. 

A local took us to his hut and called his wife. The hut was located on a steep slope of the mountain with a stream flowing down in the valley. The opposite mountain was uninhabited by humans.

The woman came out dig deep into her pocket and threw a packet towards us across 10 feet on the ground. 

Weird feeling, but a fresh perspective nonetheless.;My father is Gazetted Officer (in ministry of social defence now retired) and in early days, in his office the watchmen or the helper refused to bring him water, newspaper or switch on the AC.
No, he didn't have a SC certificate, he's the only one to have a degree from his village in West Bengal because guess what he was not allowed to attend the college there and now they have a picture of him in there.

But my native place till today has a tradition where during the annual mela or Jatra as its called here, our entire community isnt allowed to enter the temple.premises during mahapooja. Everyone else in the village can go but just not us. Its only followed during this mahapooja even on regular days. During the mela times theres a fencing which keeps us out of bounds. Crossing the fence is very very big crime and you are disbarred from the entire village and the community.

I have seen this as growing up and it sucks. There are people who still follow this. People send tons of money during these so called melas and jatras to keep us out but not a single penny during drought a couple of years. Thankfully our entire community has some well educated guys who have been able to bring back some good techniques of water harvesting etc and things have improved.

What's gone is gone, no point clinging on to what our stupid older generations believed in, they are dead and gone. And coming to reservation we still want to implement for whatever political gains should be done on the basis of income since aadhar is being linked everywhere and we would know who earns what. Too Optimistic? ;When he is dropping them why does he need a leaf??;The Institution of Caste become much more significant after the Independence mainly because of the two reasons:

1. sources of knowledge regarding Indian society were pure reflection of the Brahmanical Ideology during British rule. 

2. The freedom struggle leads to create the hegemony of upper caste in the politics after Independence.   

1. The Brahminical ideology of caste as a hierarchical system governed by rules of purity and pollution that were elaborated most fully during the British period. It manifested most completely in 'traditional' society as consolidated under colonialism. More recent historical research on the Caste has seriously undermined this ""commonsense' about the caste system. The colonial rulers, through the process of enumeration and ethnographic surveys, raised consciousness about caste, they also produced the conditions where 'caste became the single term capable of expressing and synthesizing India's diverse forms of social identity, community and organization (Dricks 2001:5). The influence of colonialism and its form of knowledge, to use Bernard Cohe's expression (Cohn 1996), was quite fundamental to the way sociology and social anthropology developed in India. The three ways through which the colonial rulers tries to make sense of our country were the village, caste, and religious communities. This is why most of the orientalist writings identified some of the classical Brahmanical scriptures as canonical texts for understanding the Indian tradition and its past history. This Indological 'book-view' of India continued to be an knowledge about the 'native' (Indians) throughout the colonial period and greatly influenced the nationalist understanding of Indian society. so basically the idea of the caste has been very deeply embedded in the modern Indian self-image, which is itself a mirror reflection of the orientalist and colonial images of India. 

2)  A large majority of those who led the freedom movement and inherited power from the colonial masters come form the urban, upper-caste families. The rise of middle-caste during the 1960s brought the change in the political landscape of India. While in some regions the congress party was able to accommodate the growing aspiration of these middle- level caste groups, it was fail to do the same in case of small parties and that where the regional parties started emerging in India with their struggle against the ""hegemonic"" congress party. Though the writings of First Prime minister of India reflected the concern regarding the Institution of the Caste in The Discovery of India, Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, wrote in 1946: In the context of society, today, the caste system and much that goes with it are wholly incompatible, reactionary, restrictive, and barriers to progress. there can be no equality in status and opportunity within its framework, nor can there be political democracy.... Between these two conceptions conflict is inherent and only one of them can survive (p.257). In reality the congress failed to create any significant space for the people of Dalit community into mainstream politics of the free nation.The regional political aspirants started emerging to answer this ignorance of Congress.   
The chairman of Indian constituent Assembly Mr. B.R. Ambedkar, was even more emphatic on this and wrote: you cannot build anything on the foundation of caste. you cannot build up a nation; you cannot build up a morality. anything you will build on the foundations of caste will crack and will never be a whole. (Ambedkar 20002:102). 


I would like to leave the readers with two questions - 

1. The emerging groups demanding the economy as the base of  reservation, had they ever given knowledge about the Dalit writings or Dalits struggle to get the social acceptance even today in many villages of India? 


2) Isn't this picture same for the Dalits in case of Private sector today where the reservation system policy is not applicable?   






;Still exists. Nothing has changed. ;is still untouchability being considered.this caste system should not be followed all are one and should remain one...no untouchability should be done....Not in just some part but in most of India. 72% of India lives in villages(census 2011). It happens in Cities also but to some less extent and the ways are different. Inter-caste marriages are happening but at very low rates. Most of the inter-caste marriages happens between Upper caste with other upper caste.

He's been saying this only! It's called reading between the lines. When did he say go and slit the throats. He's been saying to acknowledge the gratitude towards others, and as no body is able to get out, then at least get out and gather in your respective balconies, and do small cheerful act. At least by seeing all others too in their respective balconies, it gives a sense of moral support to each one of us. It's like trapped into a void with nothing to do, and then even the simplest sight of humans around can be small little joy givers. That's the simplest of how these speeches can be decoded, psychologically. ""ghar me pade pade, bahaari duniya se naata toot chuka hai, kabhi kabaar ek dusre ko balcony me taliya bajate hi dekh lene se man ko thoda achha hi lag jata hai. aur chutiyo ki tarah taali bajane toh bola nhi hai, atleast yahi soch ke baja lo ki jo apni marwa rhe hai bichare, unko thoda thank you ya salam"".

2. Government has no 9-5 job of inculcating moral values, humanitarian values and sense of gratitude & belonging into people. It's the job of your parents see your upbringing. Even if government says hindus go and slit muslims, aren't you a human being? Haven't you got the basic sense of understanding what's called a life? Haven't you been taught from your parents that we all come from same blood and flesh? And we are all mortals?

As a shepard, you'll still try to make sure each one happy by providing different types of grass as per their need. But then after some time I give you 1 lac goats, and ask to make sure each one's need is satisfied, then you'll run away. You just cant handle the fucking quantity.

javapyscript,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001DD347FCB48>,e69fln,AskIndia,2380,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today.

I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous;I used to know him. While I was new to twitter, he also had just started the account in 2009ish. We used to talk. Later he kept SPAMMING all his friends and followers with his links and blogs and asked us to retweet them. I never retweeted this, and so he stopped following me. Also, my follower count was low and he didn't like to follow people with low follower counts.;Typical Indian youtuber who has got his head pretty far up his backside.;This guy and technicalguriji are probably the most biggest pricks of Indian YouTube. 

OP, this is not a scam exactly as you have not lost anything (other than some time and emotional distress). Even most giveaways outside have terms and conditions to give them excuses for not doing giveaways. 

If you really want revenge you need to spam his comments section and Twitter/IG. Most people follow such channels in the hope of winning a giveaway and fake promises will lose him subs and views.

I'm posting on most recent videos about this. I hate that guy as much as you.;Send this to Neon Man -Youtuber.

I think he will post this odreal on his channel.;Name and shame him.. Assholes stoop so low for likes. And then don't honor their word.

Tweet and share link here. We'll retweet and like.;A marketer with 200,000 followers on Twitter is a guy who makes shitloads of money and if he can't send a phone he promised on time, just talks about his ethics overall. If he keeps this up, he's going to have Karma catch up with him before long.;Do not delete this post. These Youtubers are biggest beggars. They want people to subscribe and like their shit. They use click bait titles and fool people. Then they come up with low quality ""Merch"" And expect people to buy their shit. 

They do these giveaways for more engagement and views. They earn a buck on peoples back but backtrack like this. 

Name and Shame such greedy bastards.

You can post there if you want to call him out.;Don’t pull down this post. Teach this asshole a lesson;Expected from an Indian YouTuber. They have such scams running to increase their subscribers.

Some of them are really good but rest just read specs. The one on the top of the chain is the biggest scam of all.;You can crosspost this to r/android or r/youtube.

That's the least we can do for our brethren.;Simple fact man, most of us don't bother to keep contacting them after a certain amount of time. So, it's a win for the YT channel. They could keep the device/sell it away some place. Good that you kept pestering them. Honestly, didn't expect this from Amit. If guruji had done it, id say yes, he is a crook. But Amit, don't know man.;Also gonna report this channel. Let's show them what they get for fucking around with general public.;OP link his particular video here, which he released stating the giveaway.

The least I can do is report these idiots.;Tweet everything out. Tag all the Indian tech YouTubers;It's a good thing you posted this on reddit or you may never have got the phone at all. To think you got the congratulatory message that you won the phone on August 12th, and it is almost 4 months later after so much follow ups that you got the phone speaks for itself. Darn, 4 months is enough time for tech to get outdated even!   


The PR team for PhoneRadar was just doing damage control by finally sending you the phone! If the guy was ethical, he would've ensured you got the phone on the second follow up - not having time is a crappy excuse especially if you have a team - even CEOs of Fortune 500 firms act faster!;So now the guy has deleted his tweet and replaced it with a tweet apologising for the delay. All his recent tweets are congratulating people on receiving the giveaways. Don’t let him get away with this OP, he’s still the same shithead, but now with a mask.;What an asshole. Ngl though OP, your mails were too deferential. Someone who keeps ignoring your legit claims doesn't deserve any respect. Tag all the big Indian channels in a tweet and post this proof, force the fucker to do something.;I don't understand this ""Sir"" mentality of people in India.

The person is still at fault;My 2 cents - Even if you get the phone, don't delete the posts. Ordinary people get famous on Youtube, and the success goes to their head. They lose all politeness, and expect their rabid fan base to defend whatever the hell they do. Unfortunately, all too common.;This is what Reddit is for!;Our country is known for scammers ..

Didn't he himself send you the ""congratulation"" mail on your email-id? All he had to do is check the email-id if he thought it was a wrong guy claiming the phone. Looser giving out stupid reason.;He just posted some giveaway winners on twitter let's go and say you are not gonna give them phones anyway.;Fuck yeah, this subreddit is making ""noise"". That gives me a lotta hope.;No reason to delete anything. The whole line argument is suspicious. You deserve that phone as promised and the channel deserves to be exposed for falling back on their marketing promises.;Thats one pos channel .

These tech channels dont give proper review and instead post these fake giveaways to attract people and generate revenue   . Chutiya guruji is another one.;Good job. This is the aspect of social media I like. Months of inaction and as soon as they started getting some heat online they change their tune. 

Kudos OP. Hope you get your phone soon. Please update us with a pic of the phone!;Well it’s just a giveaway anyway! I never trust these kind of promotions.  

But thanks for putting this up.. ! Beware of phooneradar!;Commented on that giveaway video to report the channel and unsubscribe. I know how it feels. Once I won the autographed t-shirt by musician jay Sean. And it never arrived to me. I wished someone could help me that time. But it's time I help you. Do not remove this post. Let him understand the value of words.;#PhoneRadar #Amit, if you're reading this comment then know that I know you're reading this post while crying. Stop doing this with the winners. You prick.;I am really happy to hear that your immediate issue was resolved. 

It's especially tasty when the person(s) in question get all stressed about their reputation and being called out in public. 

It really goes to show that the attitude behind the giveaway was purely to increase viewers and popularity (which, by itself, is not a bad thing) and then his audacity to claim that you were being punished with a delayed delivery and a lack of response due to you _rightfully_ asking for what is yours?! 

The fact that it took multiple attempts, across half a year, and a public outcry for the lil shit to reply tells me all I need to know about what Desi YouTuber to avoid next. 

YouTubers have to realise that if their actual personality is made public, and is abrasive to public outlook, common sense and decency; Then the quality/type of your content is not going to much of a consideration when I have 5 other alternatives who seem to be (or at least seem to display) a better, more personable character. I'd rather watch a nice person try hard to put up some good stuff, than _knowingly_ watch a selfish, and rather cowardly, person put up something more flashy.;I know the issue is resolved & we are expecting the shipment of the phone soon, but just commenting coz I am happy about the power of our reddit community. Cannot lie scammers walk away free. 

Congratulations Chaitanya!;Lol phoneradar ..They don't know shit about mobile phones. Paid reviews , just like those other ""tech"" yt channels.;The YouTuber changed his tweet reply. Mentioned it in the post."

Kerala accounts for 20% of the testing done in India. Makes you wonder wtf are the other states up to. Kerala actually has a low tested/+ve case compared to other states.;[removed];Facts:

\- Current tests that we have imported(Abbot 5min 1 is not available yet commercially); allows us to test for people who are symptomatic only. Asymptomics cannot be tested we do not have a test yet to do that.  
Criteria for testing:

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html)  
[https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/85165](https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/85165)

\- Even if the testing figures are lower one of the parameters to check if the disease is growing is to check pneumonia cases. To date, we have not seen any large spikes in pneumonia cases.

\- Kerala and Maharashtra impacted coz of the higher immigration that happens through these states and that has been the trend across the world.

And stop blaming governments the thing is nobody knows how this is going to pan out... there is no playbook for this.   
You have modelers /epidemiologists/economists quoting 2M-20M deaths and certain models stating 20k deaths.. this is all speculations. Models are flawed as these kinds of situations have huge feedback loops wherein people's action influences the outcome significantly.

My take is based on the current measures taken India will have 20-25K cases by April end. Coronavirus may reach 60-70% of our population but by when this will be dictated by the policies post the lockdown.

Either way, we have to push towards herd immunity as the vaccines are not going to be available before late next year.

The government will have to balance both the economic and health hazard any extreme steps towards one will impact another severely.;Then shouldn't there will be 1000s of death and hospitals flooding with patients alll over the country. Just asking;A lot is being made of the fact that India's testing rate is low. There are apprehensions as to how the testing is just not enough given the scale of damage the spread could do to a country like India. And tbh I think it's getting a bit over the top and unwarranted and not based on objectivity. At first even I was doubtful,apprehensive and was of the opinion that testing rate is simple not enough. But after a bit of reading some inferences had to be drawn.

1. The current testing method i.e, RT-PCR can be done only on symptomatic persons with a significant viral load. Using this method on asymptomatic persons may not only render the test wasteful but also may not yield accurate results.
2. Citing South Koreas testing rate and saying we should be achieving those rates is a misnomer for 2 reasons. A.) We simply do not have required number of testing kits and B.) It's virtually impossible for us to even get anywhere close to S. Koreas testing rate given the confounding factors of size, variance and most importantly incapacities in the healthcare system.
2. I think ICMR has devised a strategy of concentrating their efforts on hotspots and then try and contain infections in those regions. Which to be fair seems logical and scientific given the fact that almost all infections across the world be it China, Italy or even USA are region specific.
3. More than the testing, I think a more accurate picture of the scenario could be drawn from the number of serious cases and deaths from pneumonia related issues. And I simply cannot comprehend how the govt or ICMR can hide/fudge those figures.;[removed];This is going out of hands, this is not much of a government lack of effort as it is of people.;[removed];IMO all numbers should be shown as positive cases/total tested cases for better transparency. I'm apalled at folks shitting on kerala for almost any matter these days, what exactly is the reason? I understand there is a political reason but don't get what it is exactly;People have got to understand that you have to have symptoms to be tested. And if there was a mass spread then hospitals should be flooded with people presenting symptoms. Which is not the case so far.

Every person has a circle ranging from 100 to 1000 people. Just see how many people in your own circle are presenting symptoms. Just a small exercise to see how many actually need the test.;Oh bhai haha lolz;Masterstroke;I think India is yet to hit its peak. The current time and money should be invested in getting in the infrastructure to work and develop, research new testing kits and facilities;You people just criticize everything that you can find in a person you don't like but don't have the balls yourself to make a change if given power;I have serious doubts about bihar with only 15 cases;Orrr test one person at least five times.;https://www.indiaspend.com/states-that-are-testing-more-are-detecting-more-cases-data-show/;I am a data scientist. I have been shouting on top of my voice. So much so that I've written to my state government and central government about how the sample size is too low to draw conclusions. Not one person has responded. 

I live in Hyderabad. The government wants to open lockdown by 7th April(instead of 14th). This is a ludicrous move. If anything we need at least a 35 day lockdown. 

Let me explain:
 the mean for Covid-19 symptoms is 14 days. The Outliers are 3days to 32 days. In this time these cases must be reported (reported is the word mind you) but in some cases systems are so mild that this will go unchecked. 

The unchecked mildly symptomatic are the crux of the Covid 19 problem. If you don't test you won't know that these people have been affected. The will be carriees and will spread the disease. 
 Up until last week we tested 30,000 cases for  a population of 1.3 billion. *slow claps*

It's not about BJP or Congress or TRS. It's about your health. 
We should have at least tested 9-10 lakh people by now. 
We have the capacity of doing 70,000 test per day as of now. Then why are our testing kits lying around? 

Cant stress this enough. 
Test, 
Test, 
Test.;look at his so broad nose!! hahhahaha;As far as I know majority of testing is going on for people who entered India. Local testing is very small percentage proportional to incoming from abroad. More we test more cases we find. 


We are sitting on time bomb. If it explodes God Have mercy. And if it does not after lock down is over it may be because of measures from Govt or CORONA is not what it seems.;If that is the case then why are the number of cases increasing ?

1. You cannot go door to door and test people, just not possible in such a huge country.

2. Most tests that are available can only test people with symptoms, not asymptomatic ones.

3. You cannot randomly test say 1 lakh people and then come up with numbers. You need an algorithm. I'm assuming a lot of people here would be from IT. The government is currently using some kind of a Depth-First search starting from a confirmed case with its nodes being people they came in contact with. I'm not an expert but I can't think of a better algorithm than this one at the present moment.;Megamind 8 pm pradhan sevak.;We are still a developing country . It's hard for us to do mass testing.

No?

Then check out [Mastodon (dot) art](https://mastodon.art/about).

[Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/)

Pixelfed has several instances, too. Users on  Mastodon and Pixelfed can also interact with other! How cool is that?

No one for ACAB?;Here's an incident that happened some time ago  that I'd like to share:

My mother is a teacher in a government school. The keeper who works there is dirt poor. Poor woman had been suffering from shoulder pain for some time, so her neighbour recommend her a doctor who doesn't charge a paisa and works pro bono. Here's what happened: she went there, got checked up, and this ""doctor"" prescribed her Amway products. Protein, iron, and whatnot amounting to 5800/-. You connect the dots. She mentioned that to my mother, and she casually mentioned that to me. I called her immediately and asked her to never visit that doctor again.  

It's a dog eat dog eat world out here. She said,  she had known this neighbour for for so long, it is almost impossible she'd do such a thing to her. Most probably, her neighbour got duped too, and was trying to recover some of the lost money through her. I wanted to see the actual receipt so i could call that doctor and fuck his shit up. She never shared the photo.

I appreciate these awareness campaigns. They are better than doing absolutely nothing. Also, fuck that doctor. ;People who use this meme haven't watched the movie;Enough with the police memes posts already;21 din mein paise double;People complaining about meme being incorrect from it’ origin

What do you mean, it's part of the road!;Auto drivers are the fucking worst

Anytime someone hails an auto, they immediately slow the fuck down and either stop in the fucking road or turn violently without even signalling.

I have to constantly be on the lookout for rogue autos;Actually barely enough room for pedestrian.;In Gujarat though I saw a new thing people drive in any direction of the road left, right , horizontal, wrong direction, u turn, you name it. The bus drivers are worst. Forget about lane system cause hardly anyone knows about it. If you are from other state and think that people follow traffic rules here than you're highly mistaken, you stop at a traffic signal and people will start insulting you or atleast start honking like maniacs.

The funny thing is in Ahmedabad if a road is totally empty the uncle/auntie/Ben/Bhai would drive at 10kmph leisurely looking at the scenery of gobar and ridiculous architecture but as soon as it jams everyone has to go fast and starts honking.

Another even funnier thing is if there is no traffic jam just send one Ahmedabad traffic cop the guy will make it sure to make the place a complete mess and to jam it by calling two sides of traffic at once.

Bade log bade log.

Yours truly
Vikas.;Bus drivers and auto drivers are the biggest douchebags on indian roads, assholes behave like goons. Their driving is not any different though fuckers drive like they're gonna kill people. ;I was once in an auto which went in through the entrance of a large office complex and came out of the exit to avoid the traffic. The security guards were screaming their hearts out. ;They drive extremely slow on the left lanes of the road looking for customers and hindering 2 wheelers paths. And Once they get a customer its basically John from dhoom machale dhoom;Imgflip and impact fonts are the real MVP;I should drive my auto in the middle lane because I am cruising at the speed of 180kmph.;Couldnt have seen this at a better time. An auto guy hit my car from behind and tore my cars numberplate and bumper!! Fucker looked at me as if it was my fault , and when I confronted ran away before I could block his sorry ass!! Asshole will die in hell!! ;we all know AUTO is faster than Tesla;Auto driver to wheeler : if the path is good enough for u, it's good enough for me. Worst case I'll just block the path!;I've long theorized that auto drivers drive so recklessly because they're the souls of two wheeler drivers caught inside the bodies of three wheeler drivers. ;I had the misfortune of having an auto driver that got into an argument with a motorist. The (autowala) kept hitting the motorist's side mirror, but it couldn't have been better when the light turned green and the motorist broke the autowala's side mirror and ran away. ;Life Pro Tip : When behind an auto, make sure you have sufficient buffer distance and your fingers/foot on the brake pedal.   


Expert LPT : Don't tailgate Autorickshaws or Buses.;Was looking for a 'Shitpost' flair while posting this.. Why is it not there?;Auto drivers should first be de-unionized. Only then will the fuckers lose their gunda mentality. ;Infact traffic jams are caused by this mentality in the first place.

;I hate rickshaws. They always block that path.;Ye auto waale, truck waale, bus waale, car waale, bike waale sab chutiye hai. Saala mein bhi chutiya huun. ;>during a traffic jam

From the videos and testimonials I've witnessed, this is India's traffic always. ;Man, they're a nuisance! ;Indian roads are basically like, 
_here's a smooth path, ab Tommy chu!_;And how none on them seem to grasp that as a three-wheeler, autos are kind of unstable. I have literally been scared for my life in an auto on multiple occasions.;Ahhahaha
;Jay walkers and Autowallahs : cars have brakes they will stop, we won't ! ;I often use auto as a last mode of transportation, once I was visiting Kashmiri gate from south Delhi to attend a wedding.

Ola and uber prices were on surge i.e around 1000-1200 (lol)

So I book a ride in auto and this auto driver was a lonely guy, start talking endlessly about his private life and wife and all. While talking his acceleration keeps on increasing and touched around 130kmph.
I was dressed nicely with a twisted hairs with gel and spray buy it all ended up in a horror for me.
The clothes and hairs were looking as though I was out on a run.
